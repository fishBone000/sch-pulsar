240	We heard of a ship that answered a distress beacon. but it was an ambush. The crew was lured in. willing to aid some poor fellow and hoping for a modest reward. And then their ship was blown to pieces. Who would do something like that?	我们听说有一艘船回应了一个求救信号.大伙都愿意帮助一些可怜的家伙.但谁能想到这是一个伏击.船员们被引诱进陷阱.并希望得到适度的奖励.最后他们的船被炸成了碎片.下一次谁还会做这样的事.
241	You're asking me? Well then. my suspicions have been confirmed correct. Even you Colonial Union officers have no idea what happened. If that's the case. then only those with access to the Command Center are likely to know anything.	你在问我.那么.我的怀疑已经被证实是正确的.即使是你们殖民地联盟的官员也不知道发生了什么.如果是这样的话.那么只有那些能进入指挥中心的人.才有可能知道什么.
242	Ah. the Wasted Wing. I prefer not to add kindling to rumors. but something big must have happened there for the Command Center to initiate such a drastic protocol. I wish I could tell you more. but I'm just a civilian. You'd have a better chance asking a Colonial Union officer. Although. I doubt even most of them know what really happened.	啊."废墟之翼".我不喜欢给谣言添加火种.但那里一定发生了什么大事.指挥中心才会启动这样一个激烈的协议.我希望我能告诉你更多.但我只是个平民.你问殖民地联盟的官员会有更好的机会.虽然.我甚至怀疑他们中的大多数人都知道到底发生了什么.
243	Haven’t seen your face around here. Did your ship get in recently? Better grab your supplies fast. Things are going to hell as of late.	好久没再这里看到你了.你的船来了吗.最好快点拿上你的货物.最近的事情让这里都快变成地狱了.
244	You're asking me? Aren't you a famous Colonial Union officer? I should be asking you about what happened in the Wasted Wing.	你在问我.你不是一个著名的殖民地联盟官员吗.我应该问你在废墟之翼发生了什么.
245	Hello again. I hope you're faring well.	又见面了.我希望你过得很好.
246	If you're looking for shops you can trust. stick to places like Outpost 448. the Harbor. and automated trading stations. They run legitimate businesses. Anywhere else. and you're bound to stumble upon repurposed or stolen merchandise.	如果你在寻找你可以信任的商店.请坚持去像448号前哨站、港口和自动交易站这样的地方.他们经营合法的生意.在其他地方.你一定会遇到被重新利用或偷窃的商品.
247	...Our captain is up to no good. I don't want to get into the details. but he seems to be running some illegal deals. I had heard some dark rumors about our captain before I joined. but I never believed a man like him could be anything but honorable. He's the sort of man who looks you in the eye when you speak. And that's what makes it so much harder to turn him in.	...我们的船长不务正业.我不想谈细节.但他似乎在进行一些非法交易.在我加入之前.我听说过一些关于我们队长的黑暗传闻. 但我从不相信像他这样的人除了正直之外还能有什么其他表现.他是那种在你说话时看着你的眼睛的人.而这也是让我更难告发他的原因.
248	They say this hub was first built from the melted scraps of old. retired warships. Sure. most of it has been stripped and rebuilt over recent years. But the core. the soul of this base has seen worse times than these.	他们说.这个枢纽最初是由退役的旧军舰的熔化废料建成的.当然.它的大部分都在最近几年里被拆除和重建了.但这个基地的核心和灵魂却经历了比这更糟糕的时期.
249	This is the main Colonial Union outpost in the galaxy. It was first established as a supply station in 3144 UE by a Sylvassi named Anatu. Over the following decades. it functioned as a small waypoint for fringe voyagers until a more recent influx of trade. mining. and discovery expeditions came to this galaxy. Outpost 448 has since expanded into a fully operational Colonial Union hub. and now serves as a center for trade among several different factions. It also houses one of the Colonial Union's most prestigious space fleet academies. as well as Union-authorized research labs.	这是殖民联盟在银河系的主要前哨.它最初是在3144 UE由一个叫Anatu的Sylvassi建立的一个补给站.在接下来的几十年里.它一直是边缘航行者的一个小航点.直到最近大量的贸易、采矿和探索探险队涌入这个星系.448号前哨站后来扩展为一个$$全面运作的殖民联盟中心.现在是几个不同派别之间的贸易中心.它也是殖民联盟最著名的太空舰队学院之一.$$以及联盟授权的研究实验室.
250	If you're looking to resupply. go the upper level of the station. There are several shops open that would be happy to do business with you.	如果你想补给.就去车站的上层.有几家商店开放.他们会很乐意与你做生意.
251	An emergency protocol was carried out to ensure the continued safety of Outpost 448’s inhabitants. We assure you. the situation has been resolved. There is no reason for concern.	为了确保448号哨所居民的持续安全.我们执行了一项紧急协议.我们向你保证.情况已经得到解决.没有必要再担心了.
252	I heard you were granted access to the Command Center. If that's the case. then you have more information than I do. Good luck with whatever missions the Command Center assigns you.	我听说你获得了进入指挥中心的权限.如果是这样的话.那么你比我有更多的信息.祝你在指挥中心分配给你的任何任务中好运.

257	This memorial is for the countless brave souls who sacrificed their lives to save mankind. Although it was dedicated to the soldiers of the Old Wars. I believe it honors all those who have served in battle throughout our history.	这座纪念碑是为无数为拯救人类而牺牲生命的英灵而建的.虽然它是献给旧时代战争的士兵的.我相信它是对我们历史上所有在战斗中服役的人的尊重.
258	As a captain. I can say with confidence that there is nothing more important than your crew. Without the loyal men and women who keep your ship up and running. you have nothing. Be good to your crewmen. When you run into trouble. those are the people who'll be willing to lay their lives on the line to protect yours. And you should be ready to do the same. 	作为一名船长.我可以自信地说.没有什么比你的船员更重要.如果没有那些让你的船运转起来的忠诚的男人和女人.你将一无所有.要善待你的船员们.当你遇到麻烦时.这些人愿意用他们的生命来保护你.而你也应该准备好做同样的事.
259	…Please. don’t bother me. I just need a moment to myself.	…请不要打扰我.我只是需要一个自己的私人空间.
260	I've been living at this hub for five years now. and I’m proud to call it home. I hope this outpost becomes as much a safe haven to you and your crew as it has been to me.	我已经在这个中心住了五年了.我很自豪地称它为家.我希望这个前哨站能像它对我一样.成为你和你的船员的安全港湾.
261	Do you know much about the Infected? They seem to take over entire sections of the galaxy. and I hear they keep spreading. It’s worrisome. isn’t it? What if we’re next? I can’t imagine Outpost 448 falling to anything. let alone some strange creatures…	你对感染者了解多少.他们似乎占领了整个银河系. 我听说他们在不断地扩散.这很令人担忧.不是吗.如果我们是下一个呢.我无法想象448号前哨站会落入任何东西手中. 更不用说一些奇怪的生物了... ...
262	Need to drop some cargo? I'll take it off your hands.	需要放下一些货物吗.我会把它从你手中接过来.
263	Nothing going on here.	这里没有任何事情发生.
264	Can’t you see I’m working? Stop bothering me.	你没看到我在工作吗.不要再打扰我了.
265	Our pilot is useless. All he thinks about is racing. Last week. we were at a repair station to patch up some damage to our hull. Our idiot pilot sped up and rammed the ship into the side of the repair bay. It knocked our hull down to 10% integrity. Needless to say. our captain is getting sick of his antics. If he pulls a stunt like that one more time. we'll have to look for a new pilot. That good-for-nothing fool... I don't know why we hired him in the first place.	我们的飞行员是最没用的.他成天满脑子都是赛车.上周.我们在一个维修站维修船体.这个白痴飞行员加快速度.把船撞向维修站的一侧.它把我们的船体撞到了10%的完整性.不用说.我们的船长已经厌倦了他的滑稽行为.如果他再玩一次这样的把戏.我们就得找一个新的飞行员了.那个一无是处的傻瓜... 我不知道我们当初为什么雇用他.
266	Whatever you do out there. be sure you have enough fuel to make it back. I've heard too many stories of ships getting stranded. And even if someone locates your distress signal. you never know if they're friendly. One Alliance group waited to starve out a stranded crew. and then stripped the vessel after they were all dead. Make sure that's not your end.	无论你在那里做什么.都要确保你有足够的燃料来返回.我听过太多船只被搁浅的故事.即使有人找到了你的求救信号.你也不知道他们是否友好.有一个联盟组织.他们就这样看着即将饿死一个被困船员.然后在他死了之后把船给扒了.请确保这不是你的结局.
267	Someone told me the Infected situation is going to get worse. I don’t know how many more complications this outpost can handle.	有人告诉我感染者的情况会越来越糟.我不知道这个前哨站还能处理多少复杂情况.
268	It's always a pleasure to meet another Grey Huntsman in person. Good luck with the hunt.	能亲自见到另一位灰衣猎手总是很高兴.祝你在狩猎中好运.
269	If you have an interest in taking on bounties. join the Grey Huntsmen. We often try to recruit new members through long range comms. but if you're eager to join. go to the Harbor or Cornelia station. We have representatives there by the names of Ivok Milligan and Baris. respectively. Either of them would be happy to induct you into the organization.	如果你对接受悬赏有兴趣.加入灰色猎手团.我们经常尝试通过远程通讯招募新成员.但如果你渴望加入.请到港口或科内利亚站.我们在那里有代表.名字分别是Ivok Milligan和Baris.他们中的任何一位都会很乐意接纳你加入组织.

274	We have no business with you. Be on your way.	我们与你没有任何关系.上路吧.
275	That Sylvassi over there is a bounty hunter. I'm a bit envious. to be honest. Any sort of work would be better than belonging to the W.D. Corporation. like I do. Oh. please. don't tell Captain Kraimer I said that. I'll get in all kinds of trouble.	那边的希尔瓦西是个赏金猎人.说实话.我有点羡慕.任何形式的工作都比像我现在的W.D.公司要好.哦 请不要告诉Kraimer上尉我说过这些话.我会惹上各种麻烦的.
276	I have a bit of advice for you. Even if you find yourself in a perilous situation. don't leave any man behind. You'll regret it until the day you die... 	我有一点建议给你.即使你发现自己处于危险的境地. 不要留下任何人.不然你会后悔的.直到你死的那一天... 
277	Things are getting more dangerous out there. Be careful. traveler. 	外面的事情越来越危险了.要小心.旅行者.
278	Some say an Infected ship docked at this hub. But rumors hold little truth. so I wouldn’t be concerned if I were you. 	有人说一艘被感染的飞船停靠在这个中心.但谣言的真实性不高.所以如果我是你.就不会担心.
279	My crew and I are looking for habitable planets on the fringes. So far. we've had no luck. Some places are simply too inhospitable. even for terraforming crews. If our luck doesn't turn around sometime soon. we'll have to rethink our line of work.	我和我的船员正在寻找边缘地带的宜居行星.到目前为止.我们一直没有遇上好运气.有些地方实在是太荒凉了.即使是对地形改造人员来说也是如此.如果我们的运气不能很快好转的话.我们就得重新考虑我们的工作了.
280	A partner crew of ours wandered into an Infected sector. We were ordered by Colonial Union Command to cut contact with their ship. We warped out and haven’t heard from them since. I wonder what’s going on out there… 	我们的一个伙伴船员误入了一个被感染的区域.殖民地联盟指挥部命令我们切断与他们的飞船的联系.我们翘首以待.此后再也没有他们的消息.我想知道那里发生了什么事... 
281	If it’s news you want. I don’t got any. Just leave me be. Don’t deny an old captain his one last pleasure.	如果你想要的是新闻.我没有任何消息.别管我.不要拒绝一个老船长的最后乐趣
282	Not interested in chattin’ or swappin’ tales of valor. Sit down if you want a drink. Go someplace else if you’re lookin’ for company.	目前我对聊天或交换英勇的故事不感兴趣.如果你想喝酒就坐下来.如果你想找人陪.就去别的地方.
283	Have you ever seen an Infected Carrier. kid? Eh… Nothin’ special. It’s just like everythin’ else in this galaxy. Wants you dead. 	孩子,你见过被感染的载体吗.呃.它们没什么特别的.它就像这个星系中的其他事物一样.想让你死.
284	I received a message from one of my research partners. Sala. who was inside the Outpost 448 research wing during Code Black. She wasn't able to tell me much other than she's okay. But I'm so glad that she made it out of there alive. And I can put the pieces together. I know you played a part in resolving the Wasted Wing incident. so thank you.	我收到了我的一个研究伙伴的信息.萨拉.在 "黑色代码 "期间.她在前哨448号研究楼内.她没能告诉我什么.只是说她很好.但我很高兴她能活着离开那里.而且我可以把这些碎片拼凑起来.我知道你在解决废翼事件中发挥了作用.所以谢谢你.
285	You're a prominent these days. right? You must know what's going on with the Wasted Wing. When I signed my contract with the Colonial Union Research Division of Outpost 448. I saw the fine print about the Code Black protocol. I know that's what happened. Which means. something terrible must have broken out inside the research wing. You don't need to say anything. I know you're not permitted to talk about it. I just hope everyone is all right.	你最近出尽了风头.对吗.你一定知道废墟之翼是怎么回事.当我与448号前哨站的殖民联盟研究部签署合同时. 我看到了关于黑色代码协议的细则.我知道这就是发生的事情.这意味着."研究部 "内部一定发生了可怕的事情.你不需要说什么.我知道你不被允许谈论它.我只希望大家都没事.
286	I recently returned to Outpost 448 and saw that half the station was destroyed. My research team has been based in the Outpost 448 research wing for years. and I don't know if they're okay. The Command Center representatives say they can't tell me anything about the state of our lab. I'm worried sick. but there's nothing I can do. I'll just stay here for a while. have a drink with a friend. and hope everyone is all right.	我最近回到了448号前哨站.看到一半的站被摧毁了.我的研究团队多年来一直驻扎在448号前哨站的研究部.我不知道他们是否还好.指挥中心的代表说他们不能告诉我任何关于我们实验室的状况.我担心死了.但我无能为力.我就在这里呆一会.和朋友喝杯酒.希望大家都能没事.
287	I worked on a Colonial Union Roland for several years. Never have I seen a ship with as much gusto. except maybe for the W.D. Flagship. But even then. the Roland has a certain vitality that cannot be rivaled. She's a beautiful ship. If you ever have the honor of serving on one. be sure to treat her well.	我在殖民地联盟的罗兰号上工作过几年.除了W.D.旗舰号之外.我从未见过一艘船有如此大的活力.但即使如此.罗兰号也有一种无法匹敌的活力.她是一艘美丽的船.如果你有机会在船上服务.一定要好好对待她.
288	The Colonial Union Academy has the most prestigious spacefaring curriculum to date.

What do you say? 	我有一个联系人.他愿意为外星人的文物慷慨解囊.最近.我可能偶然发现了一些废墟的位置. 相当未被破坏.它们无疑将包含我感兴趣的买家正在寻找的那种人工制品.非常有价值.甚至是无价的.如果你从那个地方给我带来一件工艺品. 我会处理繁琐的交易细节.并给你一份利润.你怎么说.
353	So be it. However. this offer will not last forever. 	那就这样吧.这一优惠不会永远持续下去的.也许下次就没了.
354	Another Time	另一时间再说吧
355	Hello. my friend. How would you like to help me out with a job and earn some good credits? I’ll let you in on secret.	你好.我的朋友.你想不想帮我找份工作.赚点好的学分.我会告诉你一个秘密.
356	Ah. wonderful! This will do just fine. Good work. In fact. I may seek out your services in the future.	啊.太好了! 这将做得很好.干得好.事实上.我可能会在未来寻求你的服务.
357	Do you have the artifact?	你有那件艺术品吗.
358	Perfect. I’ve happened upon another location that houses an alien artifact. much like the previous one you procured for me. I’ll provide you with its coordinates. Go retrieve it. Now. there’s a small catch—we may not be the first ones to have discovered it. But a little healthy competition never did any harm. correct? Yes. of course. Do your best to secure that artifact. And don’t come back here without it. 	完美.我碰巧发现了另一个地方.那里有一件外星文物. 和你之前为我采购的那个很像.我会把它的坐标提供给你.去把它找回来.现在有一个小问题 我们可能不是第一个发现它的人 但是一点健康的竞争不会造成任何伤害.对吗.是的 当然了 尽你所能保护好那件艺术品 如果没有它的话你就别回来了 
359	Well. that’s unfortunate. If you aren’t interested. please don’t waste my time. 	嗯.这很不幸.如果你不感兴趣.请不要浪费我的时间.
360	Ah. one of my good friends has returned! If you’re looking for another job. you’re in luck. Since you did so spectacularly well on the last task I gave you. I have arranged another of a similar vein. Care to be let in on the deal?	啊.我的一个好朋友回来了! 如果你正在寻找另一份工作.你很幸运.既然你在我给你的最后一个任务中表现得如此出色.我又安排了一个类似的任务.我已经安排了另一个类似的任务.愿意做这个交易吗
361	This will do. this will do! Beautiful. isn’t it? Take these credits for your troubles. Just keep your lips tight about it.	这就够了.这就够了！很漂亮.不是吗.拿着这些功劳来换取你的麻烦.只要保持你的嘴唇紧紧地贴着它.（给我闭上你的嘴.别走漏风声）
362	I don’t want to see you around here until you’ve brought me my artifact. So…do you have it. or not? 	在你给我带来我的神器之前.我不想在这里看到你.那么......你到底有没有.
363	Wonderful choice. Allow me to send you the coordinates. According to my source. it may take a little…effort to get to the artifact. But you’re a capable lot! I wholeheartedly believe you can surmount whatever hellfire might be thrown at you. Good luck. And don’t make me wait too long. 	精彩的选择.请允许我把坐标发给你.根据我的消息来源.可能要花点力气才能找到那件艺术品.但你是个有能力的人！我全心全意地相信你们可以战胜任何可能被扔到你们身上的地狱之火.祝你们好运.别让我等太久.
364	I have to admit. I’m rather disappointed in you. I truly believed we could accomplish great things together. Well then. off you go. I don’t need useless crewmen crowding my establishment.	我不得不承认.我对你相当失望.我真的相信我们可以一起完成伟大的事情.行了.你走吧.我不需要没用的船员在我的机构里浪费粮食.
365	We meet again. my friend. You may have already guessed. but I have my eyes set on another ancient curiosity. And given your successful performance in the past. you are most certainly the crew to go fetch it. How about it?	我们又见面了.我的朋友.你可能已经猜到了.但我的目光投向了另一个古老的好奇心.鉴于你过去的成功表现.你肯定是去取它的最佳人选.怎么样.
366	My good friend. you’ve done it again. Anything I request. you bring me without fail. You are truly a remarkable plunderer. Daring and competent with absolutely no regard for the sanctity of relics of dead cultures. I see so much of myself in you. Now. I’m sure you’re eager to receive your payment. Take a bonus. And do keep yourself alive until next time.	我的好朋友.你又做到了.我要求的任何东西.你都会不折不扣地带给我.你确实是个了不起的掠夺者.大胆而能干.完全不顾死亡文化遗物的神圣性.我在你身上看到了很多自己的影子.现在.我相信你一定很想收到你的报酬.拿到奖金吧.并在下次之前保持自己的活力.
367	Is the artifact important? Perhaps it once was—a tremendously long time ago. But if the civilization that produced it really valued it so much. they wouldn’t have died off and left it behind. Don’t you agree? No. no. There’s no disrespect here. Let’s be civil. It’s not like we’re ransacking graves. I like to think of it as cleaning out old rubbish for those who can’t do it themselves any longer. Speaking of which. do you have the artifact yet?	这件文物重要吗.也许它曾经是--一个非常长的时间以前.但如果生产它的文明真的如此重视它.他们就不会消亡并把它留下.你不同意吗.不.不.这里没有不尊重的意思.让我们保持文明.这不像是我们在洗劫坟墓.我喜欢把它想成是为那些不能再自己动手的人清理旧垃圾.说到这个.你拿到文物了吗.
368	Spectacular. A few weeks ago. I sent a team to retrieve a particular alien artifact. but they refused to continue the job. They claimed to have nearly broken their regeneration atrium trying to ^find the right path^. I'm not sure what they were complaining about. but I doubt it's anything you can't handle. Happy hunting. I'll see you soon.	壮观.几周前.我派了一队人去取回一件特殊的外星文物.但他们拒绝继续工作.他们声称为了^找到正确的路径^.几乎弄坏了他们的核心部件.我不确定他们在抱怨什么.但我怀疑这是你无法处理的事情.狩猎愉快.我很快就会见到你.
369	I have one last job for you. my good friend. Once again. there is an artifact that needs retrieving. and I'm prepared to give you something special in return. Are you up to the task?	我的好朋友.我有最后一项工作给你.再一次.有一件文物需要取回.我准备给你一些特别的回报.你能胜任这个任务吗.
370	You are the greatest crew I've ever had the pleasure of sending off to the far reaches of space. As compensation for all your great work. take this Lost Colony data fragment. I'm sure you'll figure out what to do with it. Though I have no more jobs for you. I have absolute confidence that you'll thrive in any and all of your endeavors. Now get out of here. I have a lot of business to take care of.	你们是我有史以来最伟大的船员.我有幸把你们送到了遥远的太空.作为对你们所有伟大工作的补偿. 拿着这个失落殖民地的数据碎片.我相信你会想出办法来处理它的.虽然我没有更多的工作给你.但我有绝对的信心.你会在努力中茁壮成长.现在离开这里吧.我有很多事情要处理.
371	Tell me. do you have the artifact yet? I'm very eager to get my hands on it.	告诉我.你有那件神器了吗.我非常渴望得到它.
372	Though I have no more jobs for you. I have absolute confidence that you'll thrive in any and all of your endeavors. Now get out of here. I have a lot of business to take care of.	虽然我没有更多的工作给你.我有绝对的信心.你会在努力中茁壮成长.现在离开这里吧.我有很多事情要处理.
373	Visit again soon. my friend.	我的朋友.很快就会再来拜访.
374	Drift. yes! Of course! I was practicing drifting just the other day when I brought our ship into the repair depot. I'll master drift. Just you wait and see. If the Ion Races open up for participants next year. I'm going to win.	漂流.是的！当然了! 就在前几天.我把我们的船开进修理厂的时候.我还在练习漂移.我会掌握漂移的.你就等着看吧.如果明年的离子竞速赛开放给参赛者. 我一定会赢的.
375	Utilize Drift	使用漂移
376	Reactor heat? I guess that's good advice. I'll admit. I don't watch the reactor temperature very often. But you won the Ion Races. so you must know what you're talking about. Next year. I'm going to win. Maybe I'll even beat your record.	反应堆发热.我想这是个好建议.我得承认.我并不经常观察反应堆的温度.但你赢得了离子竞赛. 所以你一定知道你在说什么.明年.我一定会赢.也许我甚至会打破你的记录.
377	Watch Reactor Heat	观看反应堆热量
378	...You're joking. right? What kind of advice is that? I mean. sure. respect is important and all. but it's not going to help me win any races... Is it?	...你是在开玩笑吧.这算哪门子的建议.我的意思是.当然.尊重是很重要的.但这并不能帮助我赢得任何比赛... 是吗.
379	Respect Your Crewmates	尊重你的队友们
380	You... You're the winner of the Ion Races! Please. tell me how you did it. Do you have any advice for an aspiring racing pilot like me?	你... 你是离子竞赛的冠军！请告诉我你是如何做到的.你对像我这样有抱负的赛车手有什么建议吗.
381	Have you ever heard of the Ion Races? I've always wanted to participate. In fact. that's the reason I became a pilot. But now that I've finally joined a crew. they refuse to do any racing. All they want is for me to transport them from one sector to the next. loading and offloading cargo. How drab a life is that? Ships are racing as we speak. I should be there.	你听说过 "离子竞赛 "吗.我一直想参加.事实上.这就是我成为飞行员的原因.但现在我终于加入了一个团队.他们拒绝做任何比赛.他们只想让我把他们从一个区运到另一个区.从事着装货和卸货的工作.那是多么单调的生活啊.在我们说话的时候.他们的船只正在比赛.我真应该在那里展示我雄才伟略的.
382	Vokas sent you with the sealed box? Well. I’m glad you made it here. It’s a relief to get this shipment in. You’re probably expecting payment. aren’t you? Take six thousand…with an extra two thousand for your discretion. Thanks for your assistance. and I hope the stars favor your voyages.	沃卡斯送你的密封盒.好吧.我很高兴你能来这里.能把这批货送来.我就放心了.你可能在等着付款.对吧.拿六千吧... ...再加两千给你个跑腿费.谢谢你的帮助. 我希望星星能保佑你的航行.
383	That's truly unfortunate. Vokas should've run the shipment himself.	这确实很不幸.沃卡斯应该自己去运货的.
384	Vokas sent you with the sealed box? Well. where is it? Did you lose it?	沃卡斯给你送来了密封的盒子.嗯. 它在哪里.你把它弄丢了吗.
385	The weather is clear on Karattis.	卡拉提斯的天气是晴朗的.
386	What class of ship are you travelling on. friend? Whatever it is. better hope it's a reliable vessel. You'll need a ship you can trust out there.	你乘坐的是什么级别的船.朋友.不管它是什么.最好希望它是一艘可靠的船.你在外面需要一艘你能信任的船.
387	Thank you. I am in your debt. I’ll put a marker of the location on your crew’s starmap. I’m afraid even I don’t know what lies on that planet’s surface. From what I’ve been able to deduce with outside knowledge. the planet appears to be barren. However. there is a possibility of native life. which is most likely what my friend was studying there. Don’t take any chances. Please. prepare yourselves wisely before you reach the surface. Knowing my friend. he could just as easily be on an expedition outside of his camp range. I can just imagine him. with that ridiculous Union Research medal still pinned to his suit. fumbling with his communicator to get the damn thing to work another stretch from base. But if I’ve learned anything from my time in the field. it’s that the worst case scenario is usually the correct one.	谢谢你.我很感激你.我会在你的船员的星图上标出这个地点的标记.恐怕连我都不知道那颗星球的表面有什么.根据我对外界知识的推断.这个星球似乎是不毛之地.然而.有可能存在本地生命.这很可能就是我的朋友在那里研究的东西.你们一定要在到达地面之前做好充足的准备.即使遇到危险的情况下.了解我的朋友.他很可能在他的营地范围之外进行探险.我可以想象.他的衣服上还别着那枚可笑的联盟研究奖章.摸索着他的通讯器.让那该死的东西在离基地还有一段距离的地方工作.但是.如果说我从我的野外工作中学到了什么.那就是最坏的情况通常是正确的情况.
388	Well. then I’ll have to find someone else who will listen. Take care. 	好吧.那我就得去找其他愿意听的人了.照顾好自己.
389	Do you have planetside experience? If so. I could use your help. A friend of mine was working with a research team on a recently discovered planet. I was their sole contact at Outpost 448. since they had been trying to keep their discovery a secret from other research teams on base. However. I haven’t received word from them in a few weeks now. I’m getting concerned that something went wrong on that planet. Could you go there and find them? 	你有探索行星表面的经验吗.如果有的话.我需要你的帮助.我的一个朋友在一个最近发现的星球上与一个研究小组一起工作.我是他们在448号前哨站的唯一联系人.因为他们一直试图对基地的其他研究小组保守他们的发现的秘密.然而.我已经有几周没有收到他们的消息了.我开始担心那个星球上出了问题.你能去那里找他们吗.
390	…I see. He was a good man. I’m sorry to hear he and his team didn’t survive. Thank you. for bringing his medal to me. Please take these credits for your efforts. I’ll report this incident to the Union officers. May you have better luck on your voyages. 	...我明白了.他是个好人.我很遗憾听到他和他的团队没能活下来.谢谢你.把他的奖章带给我.请收下这些功劳.感谢你的努力.我会把这件事报告给联盟的官员.愿你在航行中拥有更好的运气.
391	Do you have any news about my friend’s research team? 	你有关于我的那位朋友的消息吗.就是研究团队的消息.
392	Thank you. You’re doing me a tremendous service. From what I know of Sargastia Tribulen. your best chance to find it would be on a planet with an acidic atmosphere. It’s usually a green. gelatinous substance that gives off a faint glow. As for Waxthorn. it is most likely to be found on planets that are arid or extremely hot. The thorn on the Waxthorn’s pod has been known to cause unpredictable and even lethal effects. Please. exercise caution and it shouldn’t pose you any harm. When you acquire both research samples. bring them back here. I’ll pay you well for all your trouble.	谢谢你.你为我提供了巨大的帮助.根据我对萨尔加西亚-特里布伦的了解.你找到它的最好机会是在一个有酸性大气的星球上.它通常是一种绿色的胶状物质.会发出微弱的光亮.至于腊梅.它最有可能在干旱或极热的行星上被发现.据了解.腊梅花荚上的刺会造成不可预测的甚至是致命的影响.请谨慎行事.它应该不会对你造成任何伤害.当你获得两个研究样本后.把它们带回这里.我将为你支付丰厚的报酬.
393	Well. thank you for listening nonetheless. Take care of your crew.	好吧.不过还是要感谢你的聆听.照顾好你的船员.
394	If you don’t mind lending your assistance once more. there’s something I need. Have you ever heard of Sargastia Tribulen or Waxthorn? They’re plant materials. of a sort.  Those two specimens are vital to my research. Unfortunately. I can’t procure either of those materials here in Outpost 448. They’re too rare or too dangerous to acquire by normal means. If you could bring me those samples. I would greatly appreciate it	如果你不介意再次伸出援手. 我需要一些东西.你听说过萨加斯蒂亚-特里布伦或蜡梅吗.它们是一种植物材料. 这两个标本对我的研究至关重要.不幸的是.我在448号前哨站无法采购到这两种材料.它们太稀有或太危险了.无法通过正常途径获得.如果你能给我带来这些样本.我会非常感激.我将非常感激.
395	These are wonderful specimens… Thank you for bringing them to me. Please. take these credits as a reward.	这些是很好的标本......谢谢你把它们带来给我.请收下这些积分作为奖励.
396	Hello again. Do you have the research samples?	又见面了.你有研究样本吗.
397	My research is going quite well. thanks to you. 	我的研究进展相当顺利.谢谢你.
398	I still haven’t forgotten your help in searching for my friend. I can never thank you enough for bringing me some kind of closure. Hopefully your travels throughout the galaxy will be safe and successful. 	我仍然没有忘记你在寻找我的朋友方面的帮助.我怎么感谢你都不为过.因为你给我带来了某种意义上结束.希望你在整个银河系的旅行将是安全和成功的.
399	I used to be a botanist for the Colonial Union Habitation Division. I would travel to different worlds. assessing the habitability of terraformed planets. I've seen some strange things happen. When you try to control the natural world to your will. sometimes it comes back to bite you.	我曾经是殖民地联盟居住部的一名植物学家.我会前往不同的世界.评估地球形成的行星的可居住性.我见过一些奇怪的事情发生.当你试图按照自己的意愿控制自然界时.它有时会适得其反.
400	It's not as cold as I like it. but at least it beats the cooling systems in my suit.	它不像我喜欢的那样冷.但至少它比我衣服里的冷却系统要好.
401	You're one of the few officers who have been briefed on the situation with the Outpost 448 research wing. am I right? I'll confess: I saw you entering the Command Center earlier. There aren't too many people going in or out of there lately. so it's easy to pinpoint who knows what happened with the research wing. Don't worry. I won't press you for information. I know you officers in the Command Center have your hands full. Just don't forget that we regular folk can lend our help too. It is ^Together. we survive.^ after all.	你是少数几个被告知448号前哨站研究部情况的官员之一. 我说的对吗.我承认：我刚才看到你进入指挥中心.最近没有太多人进出那里.所以很容易确定谁知道研究楼发生了什么.别担心.我不会逼你提供信息的.我知道你们指挥中心的官员都很忙.只是别忘了.我们普通人也可以提供帮助.毕竟是 "团结起来.我们才能生存".
402	I was out on an assignment when it happened. and I haven't been briefed further. I hope my captain will receive a report about it soon and explain things to us. but until then. I'm as in the dark as everyone else.	事发时我正在外面执行任务.我还没有得到进一步的简报.我希望我的舰长能尽快收到有关报告.并向我们解释事情.我和其他人一样被蒙在鼓里.
403	The residents of Outpost 448 seem especially tense lately. no doubt due to the wreckage of the research wing. I'm sure the top officers are handling the situation as best they can. but their assurances that everything is fine aren't helping to ease people's fears.	448前哨站的居民最近似乎特别紧张.毫无疑问.这是因为研究楼的残骸.我相信高层官员正在尽力处理这种情况.但他们的保证并没有帮助缓解人们心中的恐惧.
404	I know you. You're one of the officers who have been in the Command Center's good graces lately. You know something about the Wasted Wing. don't you? Why don't you tell everyone what's going on?	我认识你.你是最近在指挥中心有好感的官员之一.你知道一些关于废墟之翼的事情.不是吗.你为什么不告诉大家发生了什么事.
405	Have you heard about the Wasted Wing? I'm sure you saw it when you warped into the sector. It's alarming. One minute everything was running normally. and the next there was a massive explosion that rocked the entire station. The research wing is completely inaccessible. People have calmed down since the initial shock. but there are too many questions going unanswered by the Command Center. I don't mean to cast doubt on Colonial Union command. but I believe there is definitely a reason for concern.	你听说过废墟之翼的事吗.我相信你在进入该区时看到了它.这很令人震惊.前一分钟一切都在正常运行.而下一分钟就发生了巨大的爆炸.震撼了整个空间站.研究部门完全无法进入.人们在最初的震惊之后已经平静下来.但指挥中心有太多的问题没有得到解答.我并不是要怀疑殖民地联盟的指挥部.但我相信绝对有理由担心.
406	All those atrium conspiracies are unnerving. I haven’t had to use one yet. Have you? Something about the whole process seems…unreliable.	所有这些中庭的阴谋都让人感到不安.我还没有使用过一个.你有吗.整个过程似乎有些......不可靠.
407	Our ship was raided by those damn Alliance ‘gentlemen’. They siphoned all our credits and stripped our ship of its most valuable components and cargo. Left us dead in the water until a civilian ship caught our distress beacon. Those bastards won’t get away with this.	我们的船被那些该死的联盟 "绅士 "突袭了.他们抽走了我们所有的信用额度.剥夺了我们船上最宝贵的部件和货物.让我们死在水里.直到一艘民船发现我们的求救信标.那些混蛋是不会得逞的.
408	…Look. whatever it is you want. I can’t help you. I’m busy. okay?	...看.不管你想要什么.我都帮不了你.我很忙.好吗.
409	From what I understand. your crew participated in an important mission for the Command Center. Some citizens of Outpost 448 speculate that it was related to the Wasted Wing. I don't know if that's the truth. but I hope you were able to help. Thank you for your service.	据我所知.你们船员参加了指挥中心的一项重要任务.448前哨站的一些公民猜测.这与废墟之翼有关.我不知道这是否是事实.但我希望你们能够提供帮助.谢谢你的服务.
410	From what I understand. your crew is participating in an important mission for the Command Center. I don't know much. but it sounds like your mission could be dangerous. I wish you the best of luck.	据我所知. 你的船员正在参与指挥中心的一项重要任务.我知道的不多.但听起来你们的任务可能很危险.我祝你们好运.
411	I’m sure you’ve already seen the damaged part of the outpost. I doubt anyone in that wing survived. It’s a tragedy…	我相信你已经看到了前哨的受损部分.我怀疑另一边的人是否幸存了下来.这是个悲剧...
412	My crew ran into a bunch of W.D. Security Drones before we reached the outpost. They ripped up our hull before we were able to warp out. Those drones seem to be everywhere these days. don’t they?	在我们到达前哨站之前.我的船员遇到了一群W.D.安全无人机.他们在我们能够曲速飞行之前就撕开了我们的船体.这些无人机最近似乎无处不在.不是吗.
413	I graduated from the Colonial Union Academy at this station. Unfortunately. since the recent upheaval. my crew disbanded. I’ve been stuck waiting around for a replacement position. There goes my training…	我是在这个车站的殖民联盟学院毕业的.不幸的是.自从最近发生的动乱后.我的船员就解散了.我一直在等待一个替代的职位.我的训练就这样结束了...
414	I don’t have much to say. but here’s a bit of advice for you. Be wary of the company you keep. If you don’t have a crew you can trust. you don’t have anything.	我没有什么可说的.但这里有一点建议给你.对你的同伴要有戒心.如果你没有一个可以信任的团队.你就什么都没有了.
415	Although there is little information on human civilizations before the Old Wars. historians believe humans had reached a highly developed stage in their existence prior to the Sylvassi invasion. The Archives. according to the general consensus of scholars. were mankind’s crowning achievement. It is believed these were locations that held a vast wealth of knowledge. deployed to orbit human home worlds. As no Archives survived the initial Sylvassi attack. the true immensity and type of information stored in the Archives have been a subject of much debate between Pre-Old Wars scholars. What is irrefutable is that the course of human civilization was forever altered by the Old Wars. and all that is left of Pre-Old Wars Civilization resides in the few. scattered stories of what mankind once was. 	尽管关于旧战争之前的人类文明的资料很少.但历史学家认为.在西尔瓦西人入侵之前.人类已经达到了高度发达的生存阶段.根据学者们的普遍共识.档案馆是人类的最高成就.人们相信这些地方拥有大量的知识财富.被部署在人类母体世界的轨道上.由于没有档案馆在最初的西尔瓦西攻击中幸存下来.档案馆中存储的真正巨大的信息和类型一直是旧世界战争前的学者们争论不休的话题.无可辩驳的是.人类文明的进程被旧战争永远地改变了.而旧战争前的文明所留下的一切.都是关于人类曾经的一些零散的故事.
416	Pre-Old Wars Civilization	古代战争前的文明
417	After spanning many centuries. the Old Wars had finally concluded. and humanity entered a dark age. Division and corruption wounded what had once been a great civilization. throwing mankind’s progress backwards by millennia. Technologies degraded. political systems were disjointed and defective. and humans—lacking unification and law—were left to their own devices. However. a group of visionaries sought to reunite the scattered survivors of humankind. Together they formed the Colonial Union. They tracked down the distant human colonies and brought them together under a new system of intergalactic law. Soon. people began to place more value in exploration and discovery—ideals that resonated with many races outside mankind. as well. Within the first millennia. several sentient species requested to join the growing coalition and made the Colonial Union a multispecies administration. Today. the Colonial Union has united various worlds and species under its banner. forming a remarkable intergalactic community that promotes peace and cooperation. For together. we survive. 	在跨越了许多个世纪之后.旧战争终于结束.人类进入了一个黑暗时代.分裂和腐败伤害了曾经的伟大文明.使人类的进步倒退了几千年.技术退化了.政治系统脱节了.有缺陷了.而人类--缺乏统一和法律--只能听天由命.然而.一群有远见的人试图将分散的人类幸存者重新团结起来.他们共同组成了殖民地联盟.他们追踪到遥远的人类殖民地.并将他们聚集在一个新的星际法律体系之下.很快.人们开始更加重视探索和发现--这些理想与人类以外的许多种族产生了共鸣.也是如此.在最初的几千年里.一些有生命的物种要求加入这个不断增长的联盟.并使殖民联盟成为一个多物种的管理机构.今天.殖民联盟已经将不同的世界和物种团结在它的旗帜下.形成了一个卓越的星际社区.促进了和平与合作.因为我们共同生存.
418	Early Colonial Union Era	早期殖民地联盟时代
419	The Sylvassi are members of the alien race that initiated the attack on humankind. beginning the Old Wars. In the early years of battle. they were unresponsive to all attempts at diplomacy and used their superior weaponry to wreak unfathomable destruction on human civilizations. By the slimmest of chances. humans managed to avoid total annihilation. For centuries afterward. the two races fought battle after battle against each other. When the wars turned in mankind's favor. Sylvassi home planets were targeted by the human offensive. a decision that still incites heated moral debates to this day. Billions of Sylvassi were killed in the counterattack. all but obliterating the Sylvassi forces. The Sylvassi who survived the planet rending phase of the Old Wars were later enslaved. the majority of whom were obtained by the W.D. Corporation. Since then. generations of Sylvassi have been exploited for labor or displaced to guarded communes across the galaxies. Only recently have more managed to gain their freedom. and many use their voices to speak out against the inhumane treatment of their species. One of the leading figures in Sylvassi research. a man named Wulfrom Kas. happens to work for the W.D. Corporation in our galaxy. Despite the stance the Corporation takes on Sylvassi laborers. Kas openly advocates the improvement of Sylvassi quality of life and urges humans to cast away the prejudices of the Old Wars so the Sylvassi can begin anew.	西尔瓦西人是对人类发起攻击的外星种族成员.开始了旧战争.在战斗的最初几年.他们对所有的外交尝试都毫无反应.并利用他们优越的武器对人类文明造成了不可估量的破坏.在最微弱的机会下.人类奋力反抗设法避免了彻底的毁灭.在此后的几个世纪里.这两个种族相互之间进行了一场又一场的战斗.当战争转向对人类有利时.西尔瓦西人的母星成为人类进攻的目标. 这一决定至今仍在引发激烈的道德争论.数十亿的西尔瓦西人在反击中被杀.所有的西尔瓦西力量都被消灭了.在旧战争的星球毁灭阶段幸存下来的西尔瓦西人后来被奴役.其中大部分人被W.D.公司获得.从那时起.一代又一代的西尔瓦西人被剥削为劳动力.或者被迁移到星系中被看守的公社.直到最近.才有更多的人设法获得了自由.许多人用他们的声音来反对对他们物种的不人道待遇.西尔瓦西研究的主要人物之一.一个名叫沃尔夫罗姆-卡斯的人.碰巧在我们星系的W.D.公司工作.尽管公司对西尔瓦西劳工采取的态度不太友好.但卡斯公开主张改善西尔瓦西劳工.卡斯公开倡导改善西尔瓦西的生活质量.并敦促人类抛弃旧战争的偏见.以便西尔瓦西能够重新开始.
420	Sylvassi	西尔瓦西
421	Many different warships were built over the span of the Old Wars. as fleets were heavily fortified and launched onto the battlefronts against Sylvassi invasion vessels. By the end of the Old Wars Era. countless ships had been destroyed. and any remaining vessels were either repurposed or salvaged for parts. Many technological advancements of the time went on to be applied to future combat and long-exploration vessels. improving over the course of the Union Era. However. very few intact pre-Union Era warships can be found today. and none are still operational. Unusable debris from ships destroyed during the Old Wars can still be found in many galaxies. including this one. We often refer to them as ‘graveyards’ here. 	在旧战争时期.许多不同的战舰被建造出来.因为舰队被重重地加固.并被投入到对抗西尔瓦西入侵船只的战场上.在旧战争时代结束时.无数的船只被摧毁.剩下的船只要么被重新利用.要么被打捞起来当做零件.当时的许多技术进步被应用于未来的战斗和长期探索的船只.然而.今天能找到的完整的联盟时代之前的战舰非常少.而且没有一艘仍在运行.在许多星系中仍然可以找到在旧战争中被摧毁的飞船碎片.包括这个星系.我们在这里经常把它们称为'墓地'.
422	Warships	军舰
423	Sentinels were combat drones designed during the Old Wars Era. They served to aid and substitute manned warships on the battlefront. They were originally outsourced from a nonmilitant organization. which continued to monitor the production and application of Sentinels in the wars against the Sylvassi. However. when military strategists dispatched Sentinels to accompany a fleet of planet rending vessels to the Sylvassi home worlds. the nonmilitant organization expressed its aversion to further planetary destruction and threatened to remove its technology from the battlefront. As the military was met with insubordination from the Sentinels’ creators. the early founders of the Wolden-Dorf Corporation were given permission to disassemble and reproduce the drones in order to assist the planet rending fleet. In response. the nonmilitant organization cut all accessible ties to its existing units. causing them to reject human commands. It is rumored that the Sentinels were given one last directive to continue isolated. self-defensive operations in order to prevent them from being captured and employed in the wars. Over the course of a few thousand years. the locations of the remaining drones have been lost. 	哨兵是在旧战争时代设计的战斗无人机.它们在战斗前线协助并替代有人驾驶的战舰.它们最初是由一个非军事组织外包的.该组织继续监督哨兵的生产和在对抗西尔瓦西人的战争中的应用.然而.当军事战略家们派遣哨兵随同行星毁灭船队前往西尔瓦西人的家园时.这个非军事组织对进一步的行星毁灭表示厌恶.并威胁说要将其技术从战场上撤走.由于军方对哨兵的创造者不服从.沃登-多尔夫公司的早期创始人被允许拆解和复制无人机.以协助行星拆解舰队.作为回应.这个非军事组织切断了与现有部队的所有联系.导致他们拒绝人类的命令.据传闻.哨兵们得到了最后一个指令.即继续进行孤立的自卫行动.以防止他们被抓获并用于战争.在几千年的时间里.剩余无人机的位置已经丢失.
424	Sentinels	哨兵
425	Planet rending vessels were not designed for ship to ship combat. but rather—as their name suggests—the annihilation of enemy planets. The formidable technology was intended to eradicate an entire enemy species. rather than just its militia. Planet renders were said to have destroyed hundreds of Sylvassi home worlds in the last battles of the Old Wars. However. this was one of the technologies that was lost during the early years of the Colonial Union Era. Some organizations attempted to recreate planet rending vessels. but all failed to meet the caliber of the technology used in the Old Wars. In addition. the Colonial Union has established strict laws against the use of planet rending technology. and will treat offences with even greater severity than those due to unauthorized terraforming. 	毁灭星球的船只不是为船与船之间的战斗而设计的.而是--正如其名称所暗示的--毁灭敌人的星球.这种强大的技术旨在消灭整个敌方物种.而不仅仅是其民兵.据说.在旧战争的最后几场战斗中.行星转化器已经摧毁了数百个西尔瓦西的家园.然而.这是在殖民联盟时代早期失去的技术之一.一些组织试图重新制造星球撕裂的船只.但都未能达到旧战争中使用的技术的口径.此外.殖民联盟已经制定了严格的法律.禁止使用行星拆解技术.并将未经授权的地球改造视为犯罪行为.
426	Planet Rending Vessels	行星漂移的容器
427	Much of the original technology of the Old Wars was lost over the millennia. as only a fraction of it carried on to be developed into future technologies. The majority of Old Wars advancements were either recovered years after the dawn of the Union Era and proved difficult to replicate. or were deemed far too dangerous to ever be utilized again. In its early years. the Colonial Union banned the use of hundreds of Old Wars artifacts in favor of less destructive weaponry and safer conventional technologies. Even after three thousand years. there are still new recoveries of Old Wars technology. but the Colonial Union heavily monitors the study of such artifacts and is prepared to stow them away should they prove too hazardous. 	旧战争中的许多原始技术在几千年后消失了.只有一小部分被发展成了未来的技术.大多数旧战争中的先进技术要么在联盟时代来临后多年才被恢复.并被证明难以复制.要么被认为太危险而无法再次使用.在其早期.殖民地联盟禁止使用数百个旧战争文物.以支持破坏性较小的武器和更安全的常规技术.即使在三千年后.仍然有新的旧战争技术被发现.但殖民联盟严格监控对这些文物的研究.并准备在它们被证明太危险时将其藏起来.
428	Technology	技术
429	Taking place pre-Union Era. the Old Wars were an extensive series of battles between mankind and an alien race known as the Sylvassi. The Sylvassi began attacks on human civilizations. first targeting the Archives before employing planet rending technologies on human-occupied worlds. The survivors of the first attack banded together to create the beginnings of the human militia. and they weaponized their technologies in order to combat the Sylvassi threat. After several centuries of battle. mankind prevailed. The end of the Old Wars ushered in a new era. in the first year of which the Colonial Union was established and began unifying its forces on an intergalactic scale. 	旧战争发生在联盟时代之前.是人类与被称为西尔瓦西的外星种族之间的一系列广泛的战斗.西尔瓦西人开始对人类文明进行攻击.在对人类占领的世界采用星球毁灭技术之前.他们首先瞄准了档案馆.第一次攻击的幸存者联合起来.创建了人类民兵的雏形.他们将自己的技术武器化.以对抗西尔瓦西的威胁.经过几个世纪的战斗.人类取得了胜利.旧战争的结束迎来了一个新的时代.在这一年.殖民地联盟成立.并开始在星际范围内统一其力量.

431	The Infected are highly pervasive organisms that have become a major intergalactic threat in recent years. They grow and adapt at speedy rates. overwhelming entire sectors of the galaxy in which they reside. Although there is little information about Infected physiology or origin. reports of contact with the creatures have shed some light on their behavior. The Infected emit a corrosive substance that can deal severe damage to ship hulls. This corrosive substance can spread throughout an entire sector of space. making it impossible for a ship to escape damage without warping away. Certain organisms have also been identified in Infected attacks. There are usually one or more carrier creatures that release pods from their bodies. These pods can home in on a vessel. latch onto the hull. and release a number of smaller creatures inside the ship. Colonial Union Protocol states that if contact is made with Infected organisms. the involved ships must jump immediately to an isolated sector. report the incident to Colonial Union authorities. and await further instruction. 	感染者是高度普遍的生物体.近年来已成为银河系的主要威胁.它们以极快的速度生长和适应.压倒了它们所居住的整个星系部门.尽管关于感染者的生理学或起源的信息很少.但关于与这些生物接触的报告已经揭示了它们的一些行为.感染者释放出一种腐蚀性物质.可以对船体造成严重损害.这种腐蚀性物质可以扩散到整个空间区域.使飞船不可能在不跃迁的情况下逃脱损害.在感染者的攻击中也发现了某些有机体.通常有一个或多个载体生物.从它们的身体中释放出豆荚.这些吊舱可以锁定一艘船.抓住船体.并在船内释放一些较小的生物.殖民地联盟协议规定.如果接触到受感染的生物.相关船只必须立即跳到一个孤立的区域.向殖民地联盟当局报告这一事件.并等待进一步的指示.
432	Sixty-one Union-standard years ago. Outpost 448 was founded as a supply station for fringe voyagers by a Sylvassi scavenger named Anatu. Over the course of its history. the outpost fell twice to vigilantes but was reclaimed and continued to function as a supply station. In the most recent decade. the galaxy began to see an increase in activity among intergalactic pioneers. and Outpost 448 was authorized to become a Colonial Union hub to accommodate for the rise in expeditions. Darine Hatham was appointed as commander of Outpost 448 and currently leads the effort to establish Colonial Union law in the galaxy.	六十一年前.联盟标准.448号前哨站是由一位名叫阿纳图的西尔瓦西族拾荒者作为边缘航行者的供应站建立的.在其历史过程中.该前哨站两次落入义勇军手中.但都被收回.并继续作为补给站运作.在最近的十年里.银河系开始看到星际先锋活动的增加.448号前哨站被授权成为殖民联盟的中心.以适应探险活动的增加.达林-哈瑟姆被任命为448号前哨站的指挥官.目前正在领导在银河系建立殖民联盟法律的工作.

438	This is Outpost 448. It is the central Colonial Union station in this galaxy. enforcing intergalactic law and serving as a fundamental port for trade. It also promotes exploration and study. aiding those who come to this galaxy in pursuit of discovery. Since the intergalactic warp was disabled. Outpost 448 now serves as the galaxy's main center of government. Outpost 448's facilities include supply docks. several research laboratories. a branch of the Academy. residential wings. a market sector. a bar. a hydroponics lab. a Sylvassi quarter. an Old Wars memorial and the Command Center that oversees galactic activity.	这里是448号前哨站.它是殖民联盟在这个星系的中心站.执行星系法律并作为贸易的基本港口.它还促进探索和研究.帮助那些来到这个星系追求发现的人.自从星系间的曲率被禁用后.448号前哨站现在是该星系的主要政府中心.448号前哨站的设施包括供应码头、几个研究实验室、学院的一个分院、住宅区、一个市场区、一个酒吧、一个水培实验室、一个西尔瓦西区、一个旧战争纪念馆和负责监督银河系活动的指挥中心.
439	Terraformers are used under strict regulation by the Colonial Union Habitation Division. If a planet has been evaluated and meets the criteria for controlled habitation. terraformers are employed to induce favorable conditions for human life. If the terraforming process is successful. the environment must be observed for another designated set of years before it can be declared viable for human settlement. There have been fourteen known cases of illegal terraforming since moral habitation laws were established 193 UE in the Intergalactic Habitation Agenda. All offences were punished to the fullest extent of Colonial Union law due to the tremendous destructive impact on the planets’ natural ecosystems. 	土地改造是在殖民联盟居住部的严格监管下使用的.如果一个星球经过评估.符合受控居住的标准.就会使用地球改造器.为人类生活创造有利的条件.如果地球改造过程是成功的.在宣布人类定居的可行性之前.必须对环境进行另一组指定年份的观察.自从在星系间居住议程中制定了道德居住法以来.已知有14起非法改造地球的案例.由于对行星的自然生态系统产生了巨大的破坏性影响.所有的罪行都受到了殖民联盟法律的最大程度的惩罚.

441	The network is a Union-run system that connects long range warp stations across the galaxy. For a modest fee. the system allows ships to jump between any two long range warp stations. quickly spanning vast distances that would normally be inaccessible by standard warp drives. Long range warp networks have been launched in nearly every Colonial Union aligned galaxy. The network is a relatively recent addition to this galaxy. as implementation began only ninety Union-standard years ago. Unfortunately. the long range warp network’s intergalactic capabilities have been disabled at this time. We have not yet received word on why this has occurred. but the Colonial Union will keep all civilians and officers informed on the situation.	该网络是一个联盟运营的系统.连接着整个银河系的远程曲速站.该系统允许飞船在任何两个远程曲速站之间进行跳跃.并迅速跨越标准曲速驱动器通常无法到达的巨大距离.长距离曲速网络已经在几乎所有与殖民联盟结盟的星系中启动.这个网络在这个星系中是一个相对较新的东西.因为它是在90个联盟标准年之前才开始实施的.不幸的是.远程曲速网络的星系间功能目前已被禁用.我们还没有收到关于为什么会发生这种情况的消息. 但殖民联盟会向所有平民和官员通报情况.

443	Atriums were the subject of much controversy during their early development. Regeneration technology was unreliable in its beginnings. and the rematerialization process would often fail. yielding grisly results. It was not until 2900 UE that the technology was refined enough to be considered practical for more conventional use. The W.D. Corporation was the first major faction to adopt revival technology. and it spurred a transitionary period between traditional methods of medicine and Atrium healing. Atrium technology has been implemented in nearly all starships since 3025 UE. Still. the safety of Atriums remains debatable. and many people refuse to use them. 	克隆再生舱在其早期发展中引起了很多争议.再生技术在开始时是不可靠的.而且再物质化过程经常会失败.产生可怕的结果.直到2900 UE.这项技术才被完善到足以被认为可以用于更多的常规用途.W.D.公司是第一个采用复兴技术的主要派别.它刺激了传统医学方法和克隆再生舱治疗之间的过渡期.自3025 UE以来.几乎所有的星舰都采用了克隆再生舱技术.尽管如此.克隆再生舱的安全性仍然值得商榷.许多人拒绝使用它们.
444	Implementation of Atriums	实施克隆再生舱
445	There have been reports that entities revived on numerous occasions—two hundred to three hundred on average—experience severe cellular decay. Although the Colonial Union frequently utilizes Atrium technology in reviving fallen crewmen. its officers often retire before reaching such figures. In contrast. the W.D. Corporation has been known to exploit Atriums in the revival of laborers who are killed in manufacturing accidents. often rematerializing them several hundred times without regard to health standards. This has become a persistent topic of moral debate within the Colonial Union Council. but little has been done to enforce stricter rules on the W.D. Corporation. Even with widespread conventional use of Atriums. regeneration technology has not been entirely perfected. In extremely rare cases. parts of the body may be missing from the rematerialized individual. The most common organ to be reported missing due to faulty Atrium regeneration is the spleen. 	有报告称.多次复活的实体--平均两百到三百个--都经历了严重的细胞衰变.尽管殖民地联盟经常利用克隆再生技术使堕落的船员复活.但其官员往往在达到这种数字之前就退休了.相比之下.W.D.公司已经知道利用克隆再生来复活在生产事故中丧生的工人.经常不顾健康标准将他们重新物质化几百次.这已经成为殖民地联盟委员会内部道德辩论的一个持久话题.但在对W.D.公司实施更严格的规则方面却没有什么作为.即使克隆再生的常规使用很广泛.再生技术也没有完全完善.在极其罕见的情况下.再物质化的个体可能会丢失身体的一部分.据报道.由于错误的克隆再生技术.最常见的器官丢失是脾脏.
446	Complications with Atriums	克隆再生并发症
447	Atriums are a form of regeneration technology used to resurrect deceased individuals. Over the course of their development and implementation. Atriums have been a target of scientific and ethical debates. Despite improvements in the machinery. there are still concerns that it poses permanent risks to the health of rematerialized individuals. The Colonial Union acknowledges these concerns. and ordinarily leaves the use of regeneration technology up to personal discretion. 	克隆再生舱是一种再生技术.用于复活已故的人.在其发展和实施过程中.克隆再生舱一直是科学和伦理辩论的目标.尽管机器有了改进.但仍有人担心它对再物质化的人的健康构成永久性的风险.殖民联盟承认这些担忧.通常情况下.再生技术的使用由个人决定.

449	Station #231 was a small base established by the W.D. Corporation in 3159 UE. but it went mostly unused for many years. With the recent surge of exploration on the fringes however. the Corporation sent more personnel to Station #231 and declared it the central base of W.D. operations in this galaxy. It is led by Chief Supervisor Sullivan Vorcolp and Vice Supervisor Oskal Shardes. In the past decade. Vorcolp and Shardes established strict sector boundaries to prevent any non-personnel from passing through W.D. space. The severity of their zone restrictions has been the source of much conflict between W.D. Headquarters and the Command Center of Outpost 448. 	231号站是W.D.公司在3159 UE建立的一个小型基地.但它多年来大多没有使用.然而.随着最近在边缘地区的探索热潮.公司向231号站派遣了更多的人员.并宣布它是W.D.在这个星系中的中央基地.它由首席主管沙利文-沃科普和副主管奥斯卡-沙尔德斯领导.在过去的十年里.沃尔科普和沙尔德人建立了严格的区域边界.防止任何非人员通过W.D.空间.他们的区域限制的严重性一直是W.D.总部和448号前哨指挥中心之间许多冲突的根源.

451	The Harbor is a small planetary outpost that was built in 3188 UE. It was designed and constructed by a civilian engineer named Gar Bastlen. who continues to maintain the base to this day. In 3200 UE. the Outpost 448 Command Center officially recognized the Harbor as a safe location for spacefarers to resupply. and it has since become a haven for Colonial Union officers. W.D. personnel. and civilians alike. The Harbor is also well-known for its harsh rules regarding members of the Alliance of Gentlemen. Over the past decade. several unlawful crews were identified by staff of the Harbor and turned over to Colonial Union authorities. 	港湾是一个小型的行星前哨基地.建于3188年.它是由一位名叫加尔-巴斯特伦的平民工程师设计和建造的.他至今仍在维护这个基地.在3200年.前哨448指挥中心正式承认港口是太空补给的安全地点.W.D.人员或者平民都是如此.港湾也因其对盖亚联盟成员的严苛规定而闻名.在过去的十年里.港湾的工作人员发现了几个非法的船员.并将其交给了殖民地联盟当局.

455	According to rumor. the Estate is the main intergalactic haven of the Alliance of Gentlemen. It is said that a W.D. flagship was stolen by Gentlemen during its construction. and it now roams the galaxies under Gentlemen control. Many believe the Estate is a mere story spread by Alliance members to spread fear among spacefarers and civilian crews. However. there have been several accounts of ships sighting what appeared to be the infamous Estate. Regardless. no solid evidence of the Estate’s existence has been brought to light. and the W.D. Corporation refuses to confirm whether or not their original flagship actually managed to escape in one piece. There have been a few additional reports that the Estate is currently residing in this galaxy. but none of the claims have carried much weight and no stolen flagship has been located by the Union. 	根据传言.庄园是盖亚联盟的主要星际避难所.据说一艘W.D.旗舰在建造过程中被盖亚人偷走了.现在它在盖亚人的手中.并且在星系中游荡.许多人认为这个庄园只是联盟成员为了在太空人和平民船员中传播恐惧而散布的故事.然而.已经有几份关于船只看到似乎是臭名昭著的庄园的报告.不管怎么说.还没有发现庄园存在的确凿证据.W.D.公司拒绝确认他们原来的旗舰是否真的能够完整地逃脱.有一些额外的报告称.庄园目前居住在这个星系中.但这些说法都没有什么分量.联盟也没有找到被盗的旗舰.

We need you to go onsite and remove the outlaws by any means necessary. 	由于你从Meuva 7号取回医疗用品的过程中发挥了重要作用.我应该向你介绍一下调查中的一个进展.正如你可能知道的那样.你提供的运输记录是揭示非法团伙使用的另外两个地点的关键.我们认为其中至少有一个地方在窝藏不法分子本人.不能让他们再次出手.我们需要你到现场去.用任何必要的手段清除这些不法分子.
480	Back again. I see. Are you looking for another assignment? 	又回来了?我明白了.你在寻找另一项任务吗.
481	You found some encrypted logs? Well. thank you for bringing them to me. I’ll have someone take a look at them and see what information can be retrieved. We’re grateful for your aid in these tasks. If you are seeking more work. let me know. I have something you can do. 	你发现了一些加密的日志.好吧.谢谢你把它们带来给我.我会找人看一下.看看能检索到什么信息.我们很感谢你对这些工作的帮助.如果你想找更多的工作.请告诉我.我有一些你可以做的事情.

484	We have not been able to obtain any information from the encrypted logs at this time. However. we suspect the other location in the shipping logs is sheltering the last outlaws. It appears to be their main base of operation and may contain the rest of the stolen medical supplies. as well. If you are up to the task. we need you to eliminate the base and find those meds. 	目前.我们还无法从加密的日志中获得任何信息.然而.我们怀疑运输日志中的另一个地点正在庇护最后的歹徒.它似乎是他们的主要行动基地.并可能包含其余的被盗医疗用品.也是如此.如果你能胜任这项任务.我们需要你消灭这个基地并找到那些药品.
485	Your service has been invaluable in this investigation. Thank you for all your efforts. I’ll make sure these medical supplies get to where they are needed most. 	在这次调查中.你获得的情报是非常宝贵的.谢谢你们的努力.我会确保这些医疗用品到达最需要它的地方.
486	Did you find the rest of the stolen medical supplies?	你找到其余被盗的医疗用品了吗.
487	Harming Colonial Union citizens and intercepting medical shipments are unforgivable crimes. The Command Center has given an order for you to eliminate Captain Yolsef and the crew of his ship. the Resolution. Allow me to mark the Resolution’s approximate location on your starmap. Good luck to you and your crew. Together. we survive. 	伤害殖民地联盟公民和拦截医疗物资是不可饶恕的罪行.指挥中心已经下达命令.要求你们消灭约瑟夫船长和他船上的船员."决议 "号.请允许我在你的星图上标出决议号的大致位置.祝你和你的船员好运.团结起来.我们才能生存.
488	You’ve proven yourselves to be a dependable crew. which is why the Command Center has requested you specifically for an assignment. We cracked the encrypted logs and cross referenced their files with ship tracking data around the outlaws’ sites of operation. After a deeper investigation. we have gathered undeniable evidence that a Colonial Union crew is at the center of the ambushes on our transport vessels. Medical supplies are a valuable resource in fringe galaxies. This crew seems to be fostering illegal trade of those supplies. And we need you to put a stop to it. Would you be willing to execute this assignment?	你们已经证明自己是一个可靠的船员.这就是为什么指挥中心特别要求你们执行一项任务.我们破解了加密的日志.并将其文件与不法分子行动地点周围的船只追踪数据进行交叉对比.经过深入调查.我们收集到了不可否认的证据.证据显示有一个殖民地联盟的船员是伏击我们运输船的主要间谍.他在中立星系.另外.医疗用品是一种宝贵的资源.这个船员似乎在助长这些物资的非法交易.我们需要你来阻止它.你愿意执行这项任务吗.
489	We can only hope that these operations will cease in the future. For now. I’ll request tighter security on our transport ships. Thank you for your service. You’ve been of great help to Outpost 448.	我们只能希望这些行动在将来会停止.就目前而言.我会要求加强对我们运输船的安保.谢谢你的服务.你们帮了448号前哨站一个很大的忙.

XR-83429 is now working in the hydroponics lab. It is a pleasurable task.	你好.这里单位是XR-83429.XR-83429以前在研究楼工作.由于紧急协议.研究楼已被宣布不能进入了.XR-83429是一间水培实验室.这是一项令人愉快的任务.难道不是吗.

497	Don't cause any trouble.	不要引起任何麻烦.

499	Have you read the last issue of Galactic Science? Only twelve issues were printed before the intergalactic warp was cut off. Those prints could become very valuable soon. I'd recommend picking up a few copies if you ever get the chance.	你读过《银河系科学》的最后一期吗.在星系间的星门链接被切断之前.只印了12期.这些印刷品可能很快就会变得非常有价值.如果你有机会的话.我建议你去买几本.
500	As a journalist for Galactic Science. it's my responsibility to dig up the truth. According to my sources. your crew was summoned by Darine Hatham. At this time. only Colonial Union officers involved in a classified mission are being permitted into the Command Center. What would that mission be for if not the Wasted Wing? We know the wing was used for research. What sort of experiments were taking place in those labs? Why was there an emergency protocol to eject an entire wing of Outpost 448 into space? Why is the Wasted Wing still quarantined if the situation is ^under control^? And why won't Commander Hatham release details about the incident? What is she covering up? Do you have any comments. officer?	作为银河系科学的记者.我有责任挖掘出真相.根据我的消息.你的船员被达琳-哈瑟姆召见了.目前.只有参与机密任务的殖民地联盟官员才被允许进入指挥中心.如果不是废墟之翼.这个任务会是什么.我们知道该机翼是用于研究的.那些实验室里正在进行什么样的实验.为什么会有一个紧急协议.将448号前哨站的整个机翼弹射到太空.如果情况得到了控制.为什么废墟之翼仍然被隔离.还有.为什么Hatham指挥官不愿意公布有关该事件的细节.她在掩盖什么.你有什么意见吗. 警官.
501	You've probably heard people refer to it as the 'Wasted Wing'. though it was previously the Outer Ring of Outpost 448. From what I understand. a sizable section of it was dedicated to private and Colonial Union research. Who knows what kinds of dangerous experiments were taking place in there? Anyways. I've questioned nearly everyone in the station about it. Colonial Union officers and eavesdropping civilians alike. but no one knows anything noteworthy. And I haven't been able to gain access to the Command Center to question the officers with the real power. If you hear anything new. I'd like to know.	你可能听说过人们把它称为'废墟之翼'.虽然它以前是448号哨所的外环.据我所知.它有相当一部分是专门用于私人和殖民地联盟的研究.谁知道那里正在进行什么样的危险实验.不管怎么说.我已经询问了站内几乎所有的人.殖民地联盟的官员和偷听的平民都是如此.但没有人知道任何值得注意的事情.我也没能进入指挥中心.询问那些拥有真正权力的官员.如果你有什么新消息 我很想知道.
502	The Infected? Well. that's a bad situation. I can't say I have a lot of reliable information. but I've heard the stories crewmen have told over port ale. They talk about big. nasty things that swallow entire ships whole and dissolve their crews. Unfortunately. I don't know how much is truth or just tall tales. Do me a favor. If you happen to cross paths with an Infected creature and come out alive. tell me about it. Preferably through remote comms.	感染者.嗯.这是个糟糕的情况.我不能说我有很多可靠的信息. 但我听过船员们在港口酒会上讲的故事.他们说那些可怕的东西会把整艘船吞掉.把船员溶化.不幸的是.我不知道有多少是真实的.或者只是虚构的故事.帮我一个忙.如果你碰巧和一个被感染的生物擦肩而过并活着出来.告诉我.最好是通过远程通讯.
503	I'm a journalist for Galactic Science. Or at least I was. before the intergalactic warp was cut off. Nevertheless. as a journalist. I'm obliged to uncover the truth of these harrowing current events. The public needs to know what's going on with the Wasted Wing and the Infected. even if the Command Center seems intent on covering everything up.	我是《银河系科学》的一名记者.额..也许吧.在星系间的链接被切断之前.作为一名记者.我有义务揭露这些令人痛心的事实的真相.公众需要知道废墟之翼和感染者的情况.虽然指挥中心似乎有意掩盖一切.但我觉得着绝不是最有效的解决办法.
504	Feel free to join us at our table. It isn't often we Colonial Union officers get a break. so be sure to enjoy it when you find the time to spare.	欢迎加入我们的桌子.我们上校联盟的官员并不经常得到休息.所以当你找到空闲时间时.一定要享受一下.
505	Hello. friend. I hope that your travels have been smooth.	你好.朋友.我希望你的旅行一直很顺利.
506	I recommend the Sylvassi Brew. It's very authentic here in Outpost 448. Talk to Wilta Trem. and she'll set you up with a glass.	我推荐西尔瓦西啤酒.它在448号前哨站是非常正宗的.和旺达-特雷姆.交谈.她会给你安排一杯.
507	It's nice to converse with other captains. We can relate to each other and share the frustrations that captaining can sometimes bring. I hope you find a welcoming community among your comrades. as well.	与其他船长交流是件好事.我们可以相互交流.分享船长有时会带来的挫折.我希望你在你的战友中也能找到一个受欢迎的社区.
508	Are you here to join us for a round or two? We certainly have enough room for more chairs if you want to pull one up.	你是来参加我们比赛的吗.我们当然有足够的空间来容纳更多的选手.如果你想来一场的话.
509	What brings you to Outpost 448? Whatever your reasons are. I’d leave if I were you. An entire section of the station was destroyed. There’s only trouble from here on out. And you might want to go before the trouble spreads.	是什么让你来到448号前哨基地.不管你的理由是什么.如果我是你.我就会离开.车站的一些部分都被摧毁了.从这里开始只有麻烦.而你应该在麻烦蔓延之前离开.
510	When I worked here with a team. we set up landmines in the area surrounding the main station to keep the creatures at bay. You’ll need to exercise caution. Use scanners to navigate the landscape. if you can. And one more thing. Be careful of those creatures. They’re a bit unpredictable. seeped right through the walls of my base. Plus. they secrete a nasty substance that’ll melt right through your suit if you don’t watch your back.	当我和一个团队在这里工作时.我们在主站周围的区域设置了地雷.以阻止生物的出现.你需要谨慎行事.使用扫描仪来浏览地形.如果你能做到的话.还有一件事.要小心那些生物.它们有点难以捉摸.直接渗入我基地的墙壁.另外.它们会分泌一种讨厌的物质.如果你不注意的话.会直接融化你的衣服.
511	Old Station	旧车站
512	You see. the cold is eating through my legs. Until I can get my heating unit back up and running. there’s no way for me to move very far. What I need is a thermal regulator. There’s one in a nearby station. just a ways from here. Due to complications with my security system. I was forced to abandon my main base several months back. I salvaged what I could at the time. transferred my operation to this outpost instead. Never did I imagine that the heating unit would cut out. When I started noticing the problem. I attempted a few runs to the old station on my own—but they proved to be fruitless. If you can go in my stead. bring back the thermal regulator I need to repair the heating unit. I’ll give you a tidy sum of credits. Plus. you can keep whatever else you find out there.	你看.寒冷正在吞噬我的腿.在我能让我的供暖设备恢复运行之前.我不可能走得很远.我需要的是一个温度调节器.附近的车站就有一个.离这里很远.由于我的安全系统的复杂性. 几个月前我被迫放弃了我的主基地.我挽救了当时能挽救的东西.把我的行动转移到这个前哨站.我从来没有想到.加热装置会被切断.当我开始注意到这个问题时.我尝试着自己跑了几趟老站--但事实证明.这些都没有结果.如果你能代替我去.把我需要的热调节器带回来.以修理供暖装置.我会给你一大笔钱.另外.你可以保留你在那里找到的其他东西.
513	Do you plan to ransack the base then. now that you see I’m incapacitated? Sorry to disappoint you. but there’s little of value to be found around here. I suppose you could enjoy whatever’s left of my rations. But if you want my advice. the good stuff is by that crate over there. Consider it my parting gift to you. I won’t have much use for it soon anyhow. the way things are looking. 	那你打算洗劫基地吗. 现在你看到我失去了行动能力.对不起.让你失望了.但这里没有什么有价值的东西可以找到.我想你可以享用我剩下的口粮 但如果你想听我的建议.好东西就在那边的箱子里.就当是我给你的临别礼物吧.从目前的情况看.我很快就用不上这些东西了.
514	You’re here because of the distress signal? That thing’s been transmitting for so long. I nearly forgot I sent it out. Now that you’re here. if you’re willing to give me a hand with something. it might be worth your while. 	你在这里是因为求救信号.那东西已经发射了这么久了.我差点忘了是我发出去的.现在你来了.如果你愿意帮我做点事.当然.我也希望你能帮我.别担心.报酬会有的.
515	Distress Signal	遇险信号
516	Well. a new face. That’s something I never expected to see out here. You didn’t get nipped by the cold. I hope? Not sure what brought you out this way. but if you plan to raid my base. do it quickly. I’d rather not spend the next few hours watching you scrape through my storage for expired rations.	嗯.一个新面孔.我没想到会在这里看到.你没有被寒风所伤到.我不知道是什么原因让你来到这里 但如果你打算突袭我的基地 那就赶快行动吧 我可不想在接下来的几个小时里看着你从我的仓库里翻出过期的口粮.
517	A relief. As you can imagine. I don’t get many visitors. I’d be very near hopeless if you hadn’t dropped in. I’ll get to work on repairing the heating unit. Take these credits for your help. and good luck in your endeavors.	一种解脱.正如你可以想象的那样.我的访客不多.如果没有你的到来.我就几乎没有希望了.我会开始着手修理暖气设备的.请收下这些功劳吧.祝你在旅途中好运.
518	Oh. you’re back. Have you found the thermal regulator yet?	哦.你回来了.你找到温度调节器了吗.
519	No need to worry about me—I can handle it from here. Best you head back to your ship now. This planet has a way of keeping its guests longer than they anticipated. Good luck out in the galaxy.	不需要担心我--我可以从这里开始处理.你最好现在就回你的飞船去.这个星球有一种方法.可以让它的客人比他们预期的时间更长.祝你在银河系中好运.

606	The W.D. Corporation was founded by two weapons engineers named Banks C. Wolden and Rudinius Dorf. Toward the later years of the Old Wars. Wolden and Dorf developed weaponry for the human militia and helped in outfitting warships. producing drones and improving planet renders. They were praised for their contributions. and many people staunchly believed that Wolden's and Dorf's efforts were a large part of the reason the Old Wars were won by humans. Even after the Old Wars ended. Wolden and Dorf continued to push the industry forward with their innovations and eventually formed their own manufacturing company. The Wolden-Dorf Corporation was officially established in 5 UE and quickly prospered due to the reputation its founders had acquired during the Old Wars. Although neither Wolden nor Dorf lived long enough to see the Corporation expand past the capital galaxy. it didn't take long before it became a renowned intergalactic business. Today. we employ more than two billion workers and own the largest private fleet in the entire Union. Wolden-Dorf products have been in circulation for over three thousand years. and they still bear the same guarantee of power. quality and progress that the founders originally promised. The W.D. Corporation dominates the advanced weapons industry and sets the standard for future technologies.	W.D.公司是由两位名叫班克斯-C-沃顿和鲁迪纽斯-多夫的武器工程师创立的.在旧战争的后期.沃顿和多夫为人类民兵开发了武器.并帮助装备战舰.沃顿和多夫为人类民兵开发了武器装备.并帮助装备战舰、生产无人机和改善星球的渲染效果.他们的贡献受到了赞扬.许多人坚定地认为.沃顿和多夫的努力是旧战争被人类赢得的很大一部分原因.即使在旧战争结束后.沃顿和多夫继续用他们的创新推动行业的发展.并最终成立了他们自己的制造公司.沃顿、多夫公司于5 UE正式成立.由于其创始人在旧战争期间获得的声誉.很快就繁荣起来.虽然沃顿、多夫都没有活够.没有看到公司扩展到首都星系以外的地方.但没过多久.它就成为了一个著名的星系企业.今天.我们雇佣了超过20亿的工人.拥有整个联盟最大的私人舰队.沃顿和多夫的产品已经在市场上流通了三千多年.它们仍然具有创始人最初承诺的力量、质量和进步的保证.W.D.公司主导着先进的武器工业.并为未来的技术制定了标准.
607	History of W.D.	W.D.的历史
608	The Corporation took a massive blow when the intergalactic warp network was cut. With no connection to the capital galaxy. resources are being stretched thin. and there have been a number of deserters after the whole ^transmission^ incident. But I've been with the Corporation long enough to know that any internal strife won't last. W.D. has a way of eliminating opposition. and it'll regain control of the situation in due time. I don't doubt it one bit. There's very little in this universe that could collapse the W.D. Corporation. It's just terribly efficient.	当星系间的星门网络被切断时.公司受到了巨大的打击.由于没有与首都星系的联系.资源被压缩的很厉害.在整个^传输^事件之后.有很多人逃走了.但我在公司工作了很久.知道任何内部纷争都不会持久.W.D.有办法消灭反对派. 它将在适当的时候重新控制局面.我一点也不怀疑这一点.在这个宇宙中.很少有东西能让W.D.公司垮掉.
609	State of W.D.	W.D.的状态
610	You want to know more about W.D. Headquarters? For starters. you’re standing in it. Officially. this place is called Station #231. but I like to think of it as our ‘home base’. Any transmissions you receive from Wolden-Dorf HQ will most likely originate from here. Station #231 was originally set up in 3159 UE as an intelligence center for W.D. personnel. but it wasn’t until about fifteen years ago that it was fully established. Sullivan Vorcolp took up the position as Chief Supervisor of the station. and ever since then. W.D. activity has been booming in this galaxy. 	你想知道更多关于W.D.总部的信息吗.对于初学者来说.你正站在其中.正式来说.这个地方被称为231号站.但我喜欢把它当作我们的 "大本营".你从沃顿、多夫总部收到的任何传输都很可能来自这里.231号站最初是在3159 UE建立的.作为W.D.人员的情报中心.但直到大约15年前.它才完全建立.苏利文-沃科普担任了该站的首席监督员.W.D.的活动一直在这个星系中蓬勃发展.
611	Sullivan Vorcolp is the Chief Supervisor of our galaxy's W.D. Headquarters. He has an impeccable record within the Corporation. and nearly every project he's worked on has been an overwhelming success. Vorcolp is an incredibly skilled engineer and businessman. and the technologies produced from his oversight are often tremendously lucrative. if not revolutionary. For several years. he worked at the main branch of the W.D. Corporation and was expected to rise to the highest ranks of personnel. No one knows why he left. but he apparently requested to take over Station #231. our W.D. Headquarters. way out in this fringe galaxy. Regardless. he's vastly improving W.D. operations here. Even with the recent galactic conflicts. he has managed to keep things running smoothly. Vorcolp expects a lot from his workers. so don't slack off. Remember. he's the ultimate person to impress around here.	苏利文-沃科普是我们星系W.D.总部的首席主管.他在公司内部有着无可挑剔的记录.几乎所有他参与的项目都获得了巨大的成功.沃尔科普是一个非常熟练的工程师和商人.在他的监督下产生的技术即使不是革命性的.也往往是非常有利可图的.几年来.他在W.D.公司的主要分支机构工作.并被期望升至最高的人事级别.没有人知道他为什么离开.但他显然要求接管231号站.即我们的W.D.总部.就在这个边缘星系的远处.不管怎么说.他极大地改善了W. D. 的运作.即使在最近的银河系冲突中.他也设法保持了事情的顺利进行.沃尔科普对他的工人期望很高.所以不要懈怠.记住.他是这里最需要打动的人.
612	Sullivan Vorcolp	苏利文-沃科普
613	Shardes is Vice Supervisor of the galaxy's W.D. Headquarters and works directly under Chief Supervisor Vorcolp. Together they oversee the entirety of our branch's operations. and all major decisions will undoubtedly go through them. Shardes is a ferocious businessman and loyal to Vorcolp. Always be on your best behavior around him. He has a sharp eye and never fails to inform Vorcolp of anything he discovers that is not up to standards. Believe me. you do not want to be caught doing something that displeases him.	沙尔德是银河系W.D.总部的副主管.直接在首席主管沃科普手下工作.他们一起监督我们分部的全部运作.所有的重大决定无疑都要经过他们.沙尔德是个凶残的商人.对沃科普很忠诚.在他身边要始终保持最佳状态.他有一双敏锐的眼睛.发现任何不符合标准的东西.他都会通知沃科普.相信我.你不会想被抓到做让他不高兴的事情.
614	Oskal Shardes	奥斯卡 沙尔德
615	Bakul Faros is one of the oldest personnel at our branch of W.D. He has been positioned in several different galaxies and overseen more projects than nearly anyone here. including supervisors like Vorcolp and Ultarin. Despite working for W.D. over so many years. Faros still seems to have retained a healthy amount of idealism -- which is uncommon among the higher-ups. He's getting older though. and I've heard that he's considering retirement in the near future.	巴库尔-法罗斯是我们W.D.分部最老的人员之一.他被安排在几个不同的星系.监督的项目几乎比这里的任何人都多.包括像沃科普和奥杰恩这样的主管.尽管为W.D.工作了这么多年.法罗斯似乎仍然保留着健康的理想主义--这在高层中是不常见的.不过他年纪越来越大了.我听说他正在考虑在不久的将来退休.
616	Bakul Faros	巴库尔-法罗斯
617	Ultarin is an intense woman. but she's excellent at what she does. She's a strategist above all else. and her ability to read the market is unparalleled. Before the Corporation snatched her up. more than a dozen companies were scrambling to hire her. But Ultarin can be difficult to work with. Of all the personnel who have been assigned to work for her directly. very few have lasted long without requesting transfers or quitting altogether. Those who have. however. seem to gain invaluable experience and move on to higher positions themselves. Even though it might be difficult. if you're ever given a chance to work with Ultarin. it might be wise to take the opportunity.	奥杰恩是一个紧张的女人.但她在她的工作中非常出色.她是一个高于一切的战略家.她阅读市场的能力是无与伦比的.在公司把她抢走之前.有十几家公司争相雇用她.但是.奥杰恩可能很难与之合作.在所有被指派直接为她工作的人员中.很少有人能坚持很长时间而不要求调动或辞职.然而.那些人似乎获得了宝贵的经验.并自己升到了更高的职位.如果你有机会和奥杰恩一起工作.抓住这个机会可能是明智的选择.尽管这可能很困难.
618	Enid Ultarin	伊妮德 奥杰恩
619	Occasionally over your years working for W.D.. you’ll run into men like Drahvix.  It’s unavoidable. The Corporation tends to hire men like him. He’s agonizingly strict and by-the-book. relentless. and unshakably loyal to the Corporation. In fact. his job is nearly a religion to him—and he expects his subordinates to act the same. But even then he won’t treat you kindly. There’s just no warming up to him. 	在你为W.D.工作的这些年里.你偶尔会遇到像德拉维克斯这样的人. 这是不可避免的.公司倾向于雇用像他这样的人.他非常严格.按部就班.毫不留情.而且对公司的忠诚度毫不动摇.事实上.他的工作对他来说几乎是一种宗教.他希望他的下属也能这样做.但即使如此.他也不会善待你.对他来说.没有什么好感可言.
620	Haush Drahvix	哈什 德拉维克斯
621	Now. that’s a strange case. Roalwin Mocath used to be one of the most influential people at this branch. apart from Vorcolp and Shardes themselves. However. several months ago he vanished. Never reported back to headquarters. and HQ wasn’t able to track down his ship. Wherever he is. no one seems to know. Any other details are above my pay grade. 	现在.这是个奇怪的情况.罗尔文-莫卡思曾经是这个分部最有影响力的人之一.除了沃尔科普和沙尔德本人之外.然而.几个月前他消失了.从来没有向总部汇报过.总部也没能追踪到他的飞船.不管他在哪里.似乎没有人知道.任何其他细节都超出了我的能力水平.
622	Roalwin Mocath	罗尔文-莫卡思
623	Wulfrom Kas is not one of the main supervisors here at Headquarters. but he is something of a legend. He's a unit captain just like any other. but he was the first to run a ship with an entirely Sylvassi crew. It's well known that the W.D. Corporation uses Sylvassi laborers for certain parts of the manufacturing process. but Wulfrom Kas led the way to remove W.D. restrictions and allow Sylvassi as legitimate employees. He has studied their language and culture extensively. and even outside of the Corporation. Kas has become a highly respected figure in Sylvassi study and relations. Lately. he has been very vocal about Sylvassi rights. which has stirred up debates all over the Colonial Union. even in the capital galaxy. Some of the W.D. higher-ups have threatened him for taking a stance against the Corporation's labor world policies. but Kas refuses to back down. It takes some nerve to stand up to the W.D. Corporation like that. I admire the guy.	沃夫罗姆-卡斯不是总部这里的主要主管之一.但他是一位传奇人物.他也是一位普通队长.他是第一个完全用西尔瓦西人理念来管理一艘船的人.众所周知.W.D.公司在制造过程的某些部分使用西尔瓦西族劳工.但沃夫罗姆-卡斯带头取消了W.D.的限制.允许西尔瓦西族作为合法雇员.他对他们的语言和文化进行了广泛的研究.甚至是在公司之外.卡斯已经成为西尔瓦西研究和关系中一个备受尊敬的人物.最近.他对西尔瓦西的权利非常有发言权.这在整个殖民联盟引起了争论.甚至在首都星系.一些W.D.的高层威胁他.因为他对公司的劳工世界政策采取了反对立场.像这样站在W.D.公司面前.需要一些勇气.我很佩服这家伙.

627	There are six main supervisors at W.D. Headquarters -- Chief Supervisor Sullivan Vorcolp. Vice Supervisor Oskal Shardes. Bakul Faros. Enid Ultarin. Haush Drahvix. and Roalwin Mocath. Each supervisor oversees a particular segment of W.D.'s development. manufacturing. or transport processes. If you want any tips about who to cozy up to and who to avoid like the Glonglorangian plague. I'd be happy to let you know. Just don't tell anyone you heard it from me. It could get me fired. Or worse.	.D.总部有六个主要主管 -- 首席主管苏利文-沃科普.副监事长奥斯卡-沙尔德斯.巴库尔-法洛斯.Enid Ultarin. 豪什-德拉维克斯（Haush Drahvix）和罗尔文-莫卡斯（Roalwin Mocath）.每位主管负责监督W.D.的开发、制造或运输过程中的一个特定部分.如果你想知道关于谁应该亲近谁,谁应该像格洛朗基瘟疫一样不喜欢别人的提醒,我很乐意让你知道.只是不要告诉任何人你是从我这里听到的.这可能会让我被解雇.或者更糟.

629	Although we’re not the first sentient species to come to this galaxy. much of it has been relatively untouched. It’s ripe with untapped resources. strange planets. discoveries waiting to be made. Within the last century. more people than ever have become interested in the prospects of this galaxy—including the W.D. Corporation. The Corporation sees much opportunity here. particularly in harvesting raw materials and expanding the scope of business. After all. in uncharted areas advanced weaponry tends to be in higher demand. 	虽然我们不是第一个来到这个星系的有知觉的物种,但它的大部分地方相对来说还没有被触及.它有很多未开发的资源、奇怪的星球和有待发现的东西.在上个世纪,越来越多的人对这个星系的前景感兴趣,包括W.D.公司.公司在这里看到了很多机会,特别是在收获原材料和扩大业务范围方面.毕竟,在未知的地区,先进的武器装备往往需求量更大.
630	Prospects	赛事前瞻
631	A few decades ago. Outpost 448 was just a supply station for anyone who decided to travel the fringes. Since the outpost grew quite a bit within the past ten years. the Colonial Union declared it the central port for this galaxy. The Outpost 448 Command Center oversees most galactic activities and makes sure pioneers don't forget that rules still exist out here. On a slightly different topic. not long ago I received word that an entire wing of Outpost 448 was blasted off the rest of the station. I don't know much about what happened. but I heard a rumor that it was due to some kind of quarantine protocol. Regardless. the Command Center seems to be doing a good job of hiding whatever happened in that wing.	几十年前。448号前哨站只是一个补给站，为那些在中立地区旅行的人使用。由于前哨站在过去的十年里有了很大的发展，殖民联盟宣布它为这个星系的中心港口。448号前哨站指挥中心负责监督大多数银河系的活动，并确保先驱者不会忘记这里的规则仍然存在。另一个话题，不久前我收到消息，448号前哨站的整个侧翼都被炸掉了，与该站的其他部分分离。我不太了解发生了什么。但我听到一个传言，说是由于某种隔离协议。不管怎么说，指挥中心似乎很好地掩盖了在那一翼发生的事情。
632	If you ever need to resupply. the Harbor is an excellent stop. It’s a planetary station that was established in 3188 UE and does a lot of business with the W.D. Corporation. Colonial Union and civilian transport crews. They have good brew and a decent stock of supplies. Vice Supervisor Shardes is particularly supportive of the station due to its harsh anti-Gentlemen policies. Unfortunately. the folks at the Harbor don’t own a starship repair bay. but I imagine they’ll expand their services in the next decade or so. 	如果你需要补给，港口是一个很好的地方。这是一个建立于3188 UE的行星站，与W.D.公司有很多业务往来。殖民联盟和民用运输队。他们有很好的啤酒和不错的物资储备。由于该站实行严厉的反盖亚政策，副主管沙尔德斯对其特别支持。不幸的是，港湾的人并不拥有舰船维修厂。但我想象他们会在未来十年左右扩大他们的服务。
633	Cornelia Station is a seedy base out in neutral territory. It's mainly inhabited by ruffians. Gentlemen and Fluffy Biscuit haters. The W.D. supervisors don't recommend that you visit the station. However. I've spoken to quite a few crews who say it's a convenient place to resupply.	Cornelia Station is a seedy base out in neutral territory. It's mainly inhabited by ruffians.

634	All right. listen close. I shouldn’t be talking about this sort of thing. It’s one of those subjects that could get me fired or thrown out an airlock if I say too much. you know? The W.D. Corporation lost a flagship. It was still being built when someone sabotaged the security systems and took off with the ship itself. Ripped it right from the construction bay. There have been rumors that it’s now being used by the Alliance of Gentlemen. and they call it ‘the Estate’. If you ask any of the supervisors here. they’ll tell you W.D. destroyed the flagship before it left the sector. But there have been occasional sightings of a massive ship. very similar to the W.D. flagship’s design. roaming the galaxies with the Alliance of Gentlemen’s mark painted on its hull. Me? I’m inclined to believe the Gentlemen got away with it. Just don’t tell anyone I said so. 	All right. listen close. I shouldn’t be talking about this sort of thing.

637	One of the biggest threats the fringe galaxies are facing is the Infected. They’re a group of persistent creatures that spreads rapidly throughout a galaxy to the point it becomes completely overrun by them. It’s extremely dangerous to fly into Infected space. and a near guarantee that you won’t make it out alive. Three known galaxies have already fallen to the Infected. and several more—including our own galaxy—have been reported to contain Infected sectors. Some people think that the intergalactic warp network was cut in order to quarantine us. and the Colonial Union is desperate to prevent the spread of the Infected to other galaxies. I can’t say for sure if that was the reason. but it’s an unsettling enough thought. Regardless. W.D. Headquarters and the Outpost 448 Command Center will do whatever they can to keep the situation from getting out of control. As best they can. at least.

640	As I’m sure you know. the Colonial Union is the intergalactic system of government. It enforces laws. manages relations between different species. and oversees the settlement of planets and other galactic colonies. Despite all the good it does. the Colonial Union can be a major hindrance for a business like W.D. Corp. The Union sets stringent rules for intergalactic businesses. ranging from regular inspections of transport rigs to massive restrictions on the development of certain technologies. In response to such limitations. W.D. higher-ups have been known to make some very unsavory decisions to run the Corporation the way they see fit. and they’ve just narrowly avoided being prosecuted by Union law enforcement. The Colonial Union operates with good intentions. but it tends to delay progress within the Corporation. And with W.D.’s motto being ‘Progress Above All’. you can understand why the Corporation is at odds with the Union.  A lot of tension is brewing between them—even within our own galaxy. Some people suspect that if conflicts keep arising between the two factions. a large-scale war could break out. As both citizens of the Union and employees of the Corporation. I’m sure we’d all prefer to avoid choosing sides. But for now. the best we can do is stay out of trouble and try to keep things from getting worse.

1631	This is a ghastly planet for anyone to settle down on. It’s a glacial nightmare. Nothing can survive on the surface. The sun rarely shows itself.

1632	Preparing this planet for colonization has been a tremendous ordeal. A few factions have involved themselves in the process. foremost being the Colonial Union and the Wolden-Dorf Corporation. It’s strange seeing such different people work together to make one planetary settlement come to fruition.

1635	The Command Center is very choosy about which volunteers are to be the colonists of a new planet.

1718	Ah. are you the one who answered my job request? Good. You seem halfway respectable. Here's the story: I provided a rather sizable loan to the captain of The Wonderment with a certain amount of confidence that he wouldn't betray my generosity. I was wrong. It was one of the rare moments in my life that I was a poor judge of character. Needless to say. the bastard ran off with the credits and has foiled my every attempt to get them back. I've had enough with these games. It's no longer about the credits anymore. The reputation of my establishment is at stake. I need to make an example of this fool. If you're willing to get your hands dirty. you're just the type of crew I need for this operation. And you'll be paid well. of course. Do you accept? Keep in mind. this is a one-time offer.

However. XR-52770 is authorized to answer any questions you may have in the meantime. 	Greetings. and welcome to Lotharus 9.

2080	The colony is running smoothly. The food and water supplies have stabilized. All the structures have been fortified against the severe winds that hit us every year. Plus. we haven’t had any major disasters in over eight months now. This place is becoming safer for us. We should be grateful that we haven’t had more problems as of late.

2083	Well. not everyone adjusts easily to life on a foreign planet. Some of the other colonists are easily agitated and get riled up over nothing. Take whatever they say with a dose of healthy skepticism. 	Well. not everyone adjusts easily to life on a foreign planet.

2085	Yes. I’ve heard the rumors. and I find them completely baseless. The Colonial Union employed some of the most accomplished researchers in the galaxy to perform thorough inspections of this planet. No one ever found unusual readings or sentient lifeforms. We ran numerous tests ourselves when we got here. There’s no evidence that anything abnormal is living on this planet. besides us. That’s all I have to say about those rumors. 	Yes.

2093	We had a few cave-ins this year. which made progress slow. But…there’s something else. too. Trigaro didn’t want us mention anything unusual regarding the mines in our report to the Colonial Union. But I can’t keep quiet about it. A week ago. we uncovered an old stone door that we believe might belong to a subterranean structure of some kind. Nothing like it ever showed up on our scans. Grodan stopped all mining operations after we found it. and he refuses to break through the door until he performs a few more tests. To be honest. finding evidence that an advanced civilization once lived on this planet is disturbing. The Colonial Union’s best scientists worked on approving this planet for settlement. but their tests weren’t enough. They still made a huge mistake. Who knows what else they missed.

2097	People are on edge. Some of us have been having strange dreams. Others swear that they see things outside at night. lurking beyond the walls. Even so. there’s a small group led by Trigaro that is refuting everyone else’s claims. With the term ‘colonization paranoia’ being thrown around and arguments breaking out between many of us. tensions are the highest they’ve ever been. 	People are on edge.

2105	The colony is doing well for the most part. The greenhouse is finally thriving. due in large part to XR-29341’s assistance and the automated systems we installed this year. It was difficult to get everything working properly. especially since our resources were running slim a few years back. But the colony is in a much better place. and we haven’t had to ration our supplies as strictly as of late. I’m glad to see this colony is reaching self-sustainability. despite all the tension that has been brewing. 	The colony is doing well for the most part.

At first. he attributed it to exhaustion. But after a few weeks of the same occurrence. he grew more paranoid about it. Gradually. other people began mentioning odd dreams or incidents that happened when they were alone.

There is no civilization of whispering aliens hidden beneath the ground. There are no masterminds planting strange dreams in our heads and watching us tear each other apart. After half a decade of living on a foreign planet. we’re finally reaping the benefits of our hard work. People are beginning to realize that they’ll probably spend the rest of their lives on Lotharus 9. And since most of them were originally fringe voyagers. the thought of staying on this planet forever is starting to terrify them. That’s where all the rumors are coming from.

2123	The other colonists will probably tell you that the colony is prospering. and they would be correct for the most part. But the colony has one glaring problem—the mines. As we’ve been digging deeper. the land has been turning against us. We’ve faced collapse after collapse—leading up to a peculiar discovery that we unearthed a week ago. I believe it is a door of some kind. I performed several tests and ran it through the database. but I’ve been unable to determine who built it or how it evaded our scans. Director Trigaro has been pressing me to break through the door. However. I knew the annual inspection was quickly approaching. and I stalled mining operations until I could consult a Union officer on the matter.

I don’t know what it means. but I have a feeling it may be connected to whatever is behind that door. 	Physically. I’m fine. It’s the dreams I can’t seem to shake.

2137	The Lotharus 9 Planetary Colony has been active for five years now. In that minimal time. we have constructed and fortified the entirety of the base you see today. Our greenhouse is producing well. and we have just reached a surplus of food supplies. We have projected the planet’s volatile weather cycles and reinforced all structures against the winds. This year we also made tremendous progress with our mining site. and we have stocked enough materials to build another twelve living quarters and life support structures. After several difficult years. our focus has finally shifted to expansion. With your positive review of the Lotharus 9 Planetary Colony. we might be able to bring more colonists to the planet and open more frequent trade routes with Outpost 448.

2143	I assume you are the officers who were sent to inspect the colony. Welcome. Please. make yourselves comfortable here. I’m sure your travels have not been easy. and I thank you for coming out of your way to review our work on Lotharus 9. I will inform the colonists that you have arrived. Doctor Rosmand will want to see you before you speak with any of the other inhabitants. but I doubt she’ll take up much of your time. If you encounter any problems. be sure to come to me. I’ll make sure they get sorted out swiftly. Now. ask me anything you wish about the state of the colony. 	I assume you are the officers who were sent to inspect the colony. Welcome.

2147	Most of the colony’s facilities are stable nowadays. even with the terrible winds we get on Lotharus 9.

2148	I’ve been…seeing things. Trigaro didn’t want us to say anything to the Union. but it’s worrying me. A few years ago. one of the engineers who came with us to Lotharus 9 started seeing things too. He jumped off the second level of the Colony Center and had to be taken back to Outpost 448 in restraints. I remember he mentioned something about blue lights. Now. I’ve been seeing blue lights outside the colony. and I dream about them every night. I’m just doing my best to keep my mind sharp and stay away from the Colony Center. 	I’ve been…seeing things.

2157	Recently. the colonists have been exhibiting telltale signs of colonization paranoia. They claim to have dreams of other beings watching them. and they’ve been spreading stories that we are not alone on this planet. I don’t know exactly when the rumors began. as most of the colonists have been avoiding the subject during their health assessments with me. Alarmingly. some seem to be experiencing similar symptoms to the man we sent back to Outpost 448 several years ago. Please. speak with the colonists. See if you can figure out what’s going on here. The colonists need proof that there isn’t anything to fear. or that there truly is something else on this planet. One way or another. they need answers. There are a few topics I recommend you heed among the colonists: dreams. blue lights. and whispers. I’ve also noticed a correlation between activity in the mines and the worsening of some symptoms. Any further information on the mines could be beneficial. It may also be worth speaking to those colonists who refute the belief that there is other life on Lotharus 9. Their perspectives might be just as enlightening. Please officers. find the source of the rumors. We need a solution.

2159	In our first year here. we lost three of our colonists. Two perished in accidents during the construction of some mining facilities. The last had to be sent back to Outpost 448. as he was experiencing severe delusions and becoming a danger to his own wellbeing. I noticed it began with his mention of odd dreams. He said he dreamt of his own room and felt as though there was something living beneath the ground. watching him as he slept. After another few months of these continuing reports. he suddenly disappeared for two days. We searched the entire complex for him. to no avail. Then the next morning. we found him walking outside the colony’s walls. He wasn’t the same after that. He claimed to see things that weren’t there. describing them as the ‘blue lights.’ A few weeks later. he became convinced that the only way to escape the blue lights was to throw himself from the balcony of the Colony Center. He managed to survive with a few broken bones. but we had to restrain him until a Union transport vessel picked up our distress signal. He was taken back to Outpost 448 for treatment. I heard his condition has greatly improved since then. but he claims to have no memory of his time on Lotharus 9. 	In our first year here. we lost three of our colonists.

2161	My name is Devara Rosmand. and I’m a doctor from the Colonial Union Habitation Division. For the past five years. I’ve overseen the settlement of the colonists on Lotharus 9. I have monitored their physical and mental health. assuring their adjustment to life on this planet. Everyone has been managing quite well. despite the first few difficult years of habitation. There have been no further casualties since our first year on Lotharus 9. However. there is something I must bring to the Colonial Union’s attention. Some unsettling rumors have been circulating among the colonists. I’m concerned that their mental states could worsen if nothing is done to quell them.

Brunton Vazco has not left his living quarters in seventy-two hours. Lead engineer Orbick Grodan returned from the mining site with an unidentified object.

2233	We built this station several years ago to study a small dimensional rift in this sector of space. After much effort. we managed to widen the rift and open up a sizable portal to another dimension. but things quickly got out of hand. Many of our systems began suffering critical malfunctions. and we could no longer control the size of the rift. let alone close it. My colleagues decided to step through the portal and gather data from the other side. We hoped that with such information. we could discover a way to close it once and for all. But they never returned. I fear something terrible happened to them. but I know if I enter the rift I won't stand a chance. I wasn't trained for a situation like this. If you think you handle whatever is on the other side of the portal. please. find those sensor logs and bring them back to me. I need to put an end to this before it's too late.

It is believed to be offering its services for hire. independently of and without regard for any faction. Though confrontations between Lortalus and the Grey Huntsmen have thus far been limited due to Lortalus’s elusiveness. one report speaks of the ship as being ‘deathly silent and virtually undetectable’. Reward of 18.000 credits. funded by the Colonial Union. the Wolden-Dorf Corporation. the Civilian Transport Association. Explorers United. the League of Free Machines and an anonymous requestor.
2393	Welcome to the Grey Huntsmen! You’ll receive a message through long range comms when a new wanted notice has been declared. Accept the job if you want it. decline if you don’t. Easy as that. Just make sure that if you dedicate yourself to a job. you get it done. Our hunters are known for their efficiency. 	Welcome to the Grey Huntsmen!

2395	If you want to join. you’ll need to consent to a contract. It states that jobs accepted through the Grey Huntsmen Bounty Agency must be completed promptly or they’ll be handed off to another crew. To receive the reward stated in the bounty. the target ship or ships must be destroyed. Capturing them won’t fulfill the terms of the bounty. since many of these ships have longstanding reputations. Do you agree to the terms? 	If you want to join. you’ll need to consent to a contract.

2396	The agency is about half a century old. speaking in Union-standard terms. From what I understand. several captains from different factions gathered around a table and decided to form a cooperative organization in order to bring especially pesky criminals to justice. Eventually. the organization became known as the Grey Huntsmen Bounty Agency. Among our ranks. we have combat-savvy civilians. Colonial Union officers and W.D. employees looking to pick up extra work. even some Alliance members I’d guess. Thinking of joining us?

2397	The galaxy is a dangerous place these days. There are many ships that take the inherent freedom of fringe galaxies to an extreme and live in utter lawlessness. They commit brazen crimes against any ship that comes their way. regardless of faction affiliation. As the Colonial Union is shorthanded. officers are not able to handle every case on their own. Thus. bounties are placed on the ships that no one else can subdue. I work for the Grey Huntsmen Bounty Agency. We compile wanted notices from across the galaxy and offer them to able crews within our membership. If you think you can handle the work. I urge you to sign up. We’re always looking to recruit new hunters. Plus. the work runs more smoothly when there’s a little friendly competition. 	The galaxy is a dangerous place these days.

2420	There are strange things in the galaxy. many of which remain hidden to all who do not seek them out. However. there is something that we have been trying to track down for quite some time with no success. It is said to be a creature with a great eye that resides in an unmarked sector of space. Only a few have witnessed it. and even fewer have survived such an encounter. If you ever come across the creature in your travels. please let me know. It would be a great addition to our records. and I would surely compensate you for any information you could provide.

2487	Sylvassi brew has become a popular beverage in bars intergalactically. It’s often praised for its subtle yet complex flavor profile as well as its relatively cheap price. But what people don’t often acknowledge is how the brew originated.

As Sylvassi brew rises in popularity. it is my hope that the drink will help bring the Sylvassi and human species more peacefully together.

Oddly enough. this drink is the first time our species’ tastes ever have aligned.

I was hosting my annual gloom wine tasting event when the creatures in the terrarium burst from their enclosures and started attacking my guests. Everyone left. and the party was an absolute disaster. On top of it all. those animals are still loose in the terrarium. and it’s only a matter of time before they break into this part of the manor. Please. get rid of those creatures! I’ll give your biscuits a much more positive review than I probably would have.
2758	Bravo! Here’s your tip—I trust 3000 credits will suffice. If I order food from your company again. I might just consider requesting you as the delivery crew.	Bravo!

The last time we entered the vessel. one of our officers may have activated some sort of security system. It released strange flying creatures that do seem to be innately hostile. Equipping ExoSuits. of course. is also a wise idea before setting foot in the vessel. Otherwise. you might have to go through some rather extensive and uncomfortable decontamination procedures. Upon completion of your mission. we will cover the cost of the biscuit crates. The rest is up to you. Good luck. and together. we survive.

We received a peculiar transmission—a sort of language—being emitted from within the vessel. Our translators spent days figuring out the message. and what they discovered was surprising—it requested biscuits. And that’s why you’re here.

It was shut down due to a failed experiment in its flavor lab. but it’s quite possible that the abandoned factory contains duplicates of the parts we need. Would you be willing to go to FB Factory #1204 and retrieve those spare parts for me? I’ll reward you for working overtime.	We’ve encountered issues with our machinery.

I'd imagine. Since you're here. you might as well enjoy the race. or maybe even participate in it.

2944	Don't mind XR-70202. He's harmless. He was once a Colonial Union observation bot. but he got stuck sending a report. A client of ours was worried that he'd eventually succeed in sending it. so they dumped him off here for our help. We disconnected XR's long range communication system and got him mostly sorted out. Now he's a permanent fixture of the garage. He tells me half the things I do are violating one Colonial Union regulation or another. but all of us have grown a bit fond of him over the years.

3081	If you are headed into the ion storm for the race. there are a few things you should know. Firstly. it is probable that your ship will begin collecting overcharge. If you fly too close to other ships. overcharge will start building between you. While overcharge can give your reactor a boost of energy. there is also the risk that it will shut down your ship. The giant metal machines out there intensify overcharge. as well. If you want to stand a chance of winning. manage your distance and overcharge as best you can.

3157	We're stuck on this planet. just waiting for a Colonial Union rescue party. Through some convoluted bureaucracy. our situation isn't considered an immediate life-threatening emergency. Plus. it's made even more complicated due to the fact that we escaped from the W.D. Corporation. The Colonial Union ship that was sent to rescue us is sitting in space until someone can sort out the documentation to grant us passage to Outpost 448. I just hope our rations don't run out before they finally get their paperwork in order.	We're stuck on this planet. just waiting for a Colonial Union rescue party.

3182	My crew and I have been members of the Grey Huntsman for years now. The W.D. Corporation tends to be stingy with job payments. so picking up the occasional bounty contract helps bring in more credits. It usually works out quite well for us. but today is an exception. This Colonial Union officer says that his crew deserves the reward because they reached the wanted ship first. even though my crew did most of the work in taking it down. I refuse to leave this station until I get the credits that I'm owed.	My crew and I have been members of the Grey Huntsman for years now. The W.D.

By the time they sent out a distress signal. it was far too late. They were quickly overtaken by an infected carrier. When I discovered what happened. I urged the Colonial Union to track down the infected carrier and kill it. but they refused to listen to me. Now that loathsome creature is running free out there. I know it's impossible to find the exact carrier that was responsible. but I can't rest until someone has claimed some justice for my friend's death. I'm offering 20.000 credits to anyone who can hunt down and destroy an infected carrier for me. How about it? Are you too afraid to face off against the infected? Or will you help me get revenge?

3192	WANTED: BISCUIT BURNERS - 8.000 CREDIT REWARD. The Biscuit Burners are a group of raiders that primarily target Fluffy Biscuit delivery ships and are responsible for nearly a dozen ship destructions. Their persistent attacks on delivery ships have contributed to rising animosity towards the Fluffy Biscuit Company within Cornelia Station. where Fluffy Biscuit crews have already been banned from entry. The Biscuit Burners conduct coordinated strikes against Fluffy Biscuit ships. tracking their delivery routes within a certain range of Cornelia Station. Since the Biscuit Burners are well established. they need to be eliminated at their base of operations on Cornelia Station. Reports indicate that they work out of a gutted Fluffy Biscuit delivery ship within the market section of the station. Reward of 8.000 credits. funded by the Fluffy Biscuit Company.

3197	Allow me to explain why you're here. By now. you are likely aware of the disconnected section of our station. what the inhabitants of Outpost 448 have been referring to as the 'Wasted Wing'. It was formerly a research wing used for private labs and classified Colonial Union research projects. Due to the risks posed by some of the experiments. the research wing had a security protocol in place called 'Code Black'. in which the wing detaches from Outpost 448 and performs a very limited range warp jump to a safe. prespecified location. It was designed to be used in the event of an uncontrollable outbreak or containment breach. and it was to be activated only if the wing was beyond saving or the lives of the citizens of Outpost 448 were in jeopardy. Recently and without warning. the Code Black protocol was initiated. At this time. we have been unable to establish communication with anyone inside the research wing. and we do not know what sort of event triggered Code Black. What we do know is that many life support systems are still functioning. and our scans have shown some life signatures. The signatures have been slowly diminishing. but I believe that with a great deal of caution. it might be possible to rescue the survivors and recover any salvageable research projects. I've prepared several teams of Colonial Union officers to do just that. However. we need to send in an initial crew to sweep out any dangers from the wing before the rescue teams can be sent in. You have been selected for this task. Warp to the research wing. identify any survivors. and most importantly: find and eliminate the source of the outbreak. Only one teleporter is currently functional within the research wing. That will be your point of entry. After that. you'll have to navigate through the research wing on your own. It sustained heavy damage in the warp detachment. so its structural integrity is likely to be compromised. Any other teleporters that withstood the blast will have to be brought back online. In addition. a sensor will be added to your visual feed. It will display a strange signature that we've been picking up and believe is being emitted by the source. The sensor will detect the signature's surges. which seem to be linked to the stability of the station. If the signature grows stronger and more frequent. it is possible that large-scale breach could be imminent. If the source is not eliminated before then. our mission will fail. Good luck. And together. we survive.	Allow me to explain why you're here.

3206	Greetings. I am Darine Hatham. the Commander of Outpost 448. Thank you for reporting to the Command Center on such short notice. You've proven yourselves to be a reliable crew of officers. and I am in great need of reliable officers at the moment. Before you can be briefed on the situation. you must be aware that the details of this mission are highly sensitive. Breaking confidentiality will result in an immediate dismissal from your service to the Colonial Union. Do you understand?	Greetings. I am Darine Hatham. the Commander of Outpost 448.

3210	In the administration wing off Tram Gate D. there is a room that is often used for presenting ongoing research and prototypes of new technology. Inside. there is a data pad that contains a record of recent projects. Retrieving that data pad would help immensely in rebuilding Outpost 448's research labs after our current problems have been resolved. To get into the room. there are three security doors that need to be opened. each with its own admin access card. There were a handful of people within the research wing who kept the access cards in their possession. I can't say where the cards have ended up now. but I presume that they were scattered around the research wing during the Code Black protocol. You'll need to find all three admin access cards. get through the security doors. and retrieve the data pad inside. Are you up to the task?

3218	I had hoped that when the research wing mission was over. we could reveal everything that happened and finally put this whole thing to rest. Sure. it wouldn't be easy to deal with the angry civilians. but maybe it would bring them some closure. Commander Hatham. however. still seems keen on covering up what happened in the research wing. She's going to release a statement to the public soon claiming that it was a minor virus outbreak that accidentally triggered the Code Black protocol. But I'm not sure if I can keep looking people in the eyes and lying about what really happened. especially when some of their loved ones were among the deceased...

3219	Ever since the research wing was separated from the station. we've been working nonstop to determine the status of the labs and any survivors inside them. Each hour that goes by could mean the difference between life and death for those scientists. If that wasn't enough pressure. many citizens of Outpost 448 have been persistently questioning us about what happened. I understand that they're concerned. but we're doing everything we can to get this situation under control. A mass panic is the last thing we need to deal with right now.

3236	Several months ago...before the intergalactic warp system was shut down...my research team and I were scanning neighboring galaxies when we spotted an anomaly. We sent a crew to investigate and were shocked to discover that most of the galaxy had been crystallized. There were...entire sectors of space filled with asteroids of crystalline material. Even the surfaces of planets were covered by it. The scale was unlike anything we had ever seen. What's more is that the crystals demonstrated properties similar to organic lifeforms. They had the potential to be the first non-organic lifeforms the Colonial Union had encountered. Naturally. we acquired a sample and brought it back to our lab. But...we were not prepared to handle it.

3238	We studied a fragment of this strange crystal for months. For a while. our research progressed smoothly... Then we discovered that the crystal could propagate by shattering violently into shards. which also had the potential to propagate. The growth of the crystals quickly became unmanageable. Soon they were taking over their containment chamber. In an attempt to get the growth under control...we tried to pulverize and dispose of sections of the crystals. Not long after our new cleaning procedures. a crystal exploded while one of my lab assistants was in the chamber. It pierced through her suit. In a matter of minutes. she began to exhibit some kind of bony growths. which worsened until crystals burst through her skin. Before we could move her to a secure room. she began physically assaulting her fellow researchers. The situation just....spiraled out of control from there. Nearly half of my employees succumbed to the crystalline infection. It was then that...something...arose out of the original sample. It took on a vaguely humanoid form. and it began decimating the lab and everyone unfortunate enough to stumble in its path. The few of us left managed to trap it in the lab. but it was clear that we couldn't contain it for long.... So I made the call to initiate the Code Black protocol.

3298	The Delta 429X planetary colony. established in 3103 UE. currently has 121 inhabitants. Recently an asteroid was discovered to be on an impact trajectory with the planet and is expected to decimate the colony. A mapping of the asteroid indicates that there are several structural weaknesses inside it. To break apart the asteroid. fire upon its internal weak spots with your ship's weaponry to reduce their integrity. Then perform a final detonation by accessing the asteroid's central chamber and dropping your ship's reactor core. which can be done by disabling the core safety. overloading the reactor. and ejecting the core. Please note that this process will render your main reactor useless. The Command Center will compensate you with a replacement reactor once the mission is over. You will have ten minutes to eject the reactor core. After that time. if the asteroid is not destroyed. the mission will be aborted and your ship will auto-blind jump for your safety.

3328	Sylvassi Stems	Sylvassi Stems
3329	Sylvassi are native to planets that are very cold and covered in oceans of liquid methane. Though they are cellularly quite different from anything we'd see on human planets. they are somewhat comparable to amphibians. They are semiterrestrial. breathing through both the sensitive respiratory patches on their bodies and through their skin. It is theorized that in primitive times. Sylvassi may have spent large spans of their lives submerged. In modern times. however. Sylvassi spend a significant portion of their lives on land or in space vessels. Thus. their architecture commonly incorporates liquid methane baths. and their suits provide them with a controlled temperature. breathable gas. and moisture for their rather delicate skin. With all the methane in their suits. they are highly susceptible to fire.	Sylvassi are native to planets that are very cold and covered in oceans of liquid methane. Though they are cellularly quite different from anything we'd see on human planets. they are somewhat comparable to amphibians. They are semiterrestrial. breathing through both the sensitive respiratory patches on their bodies and through their skin. It is theorized that in primitive times.

3331	Sylvassi are omnivores. with their natural diet being composed of animal and plant life from their liquid methane seas. Out here in a fringe galaxy. however. the Sylvassi eat much the same replicated crap that humans eat. Sylvassi cannot properly digest human food. but they have processors in their suits that restructure the atoms to make it more suitable for consumption. Within their suits is a network of tubes that can administer the processed food matter into their mouths. It's not particularly enjoyable. but it's more efficient than having to go into an environment-controlled room and remove their suits every time they need to eat. On the other hand. Sylvassi brew is meant to be served blisteringly cold with a liquid methane base. It's impossible for humans to consume. but many bars and breweries have made changes to the recipe to make it suitable for human consumption. Fake Sylvassi brew is far from the real thing. but Tisa claims that the Nova bar here in Outpost 448 does a decent job at producing a similar flavor. at least to her palette.

3333	The Sylvassi egg case looks like a cloudy spiral with dark eggs inside. We use the term ^case^. but really it's like a long sleeve of tissue comprised of hundreds of folds that stick together in a coiled shape until the embryos grow larger. Spirals are actually a common motif in Sylvassi art. representing life. But I digress. This spiral of tissue is difficult to rip. particularly in its early stages. and acts as a protective barrier for the eggs. The Y gender. identifiable by their lack of head crests and their spiny nasal ridges. is usually responsible for injecting nutritional fluid--a stored byproduct of their own digested food--into the case for the embryos to absorb. The case unfolds and stretches as the embryos mature. until they are about twenty-five percent their full grown size. This process takes around seven Union-standard months. When the case bursts. the young Sylvassi are gently brought into society much like human children. Siblings laid in the same case are said to have empathetic links with each other. though whether this is factual or just spiritual conjecture has yet to be proved. Tisa swears she can sense her siblings' wellbeing across galaxies. and it has been a point of frequent debate between us. From a scientific standpoint. I have trouble believing her. But as a mother. I. too. feel a strong connection to my child. Then again. perhaps I'm just lucky to have my daughter working in the hydroponics lab down the hall.

3335	To go into more detail. the X gender. which has short head crests. is the greatest contributor of genetic data during reproduction. In one of the few traditions we believe have stuck with the Sylvassi since the Pre-Old Wars Era. the X gender is often groomed to represent familial lines. A lot of pressure is placed on them to stay healthy. be successful. and avoid dangerous activities or professions. Some old-fashioned X genders even refuse atrium medical care for fear of a glitch tampering with their genetic code. These views have become slightly more antiquated over the years. but X genders still shoulder a great deal of expectation from their progenitors. Y gendered Sylvassi have no crests on their heads and very prominent nasal ridges that almost look like spines. The Y gender's body contains a sack of nutritious clear fluid produced from his digested food. as well as a mucous-coated stinger that can inject the fluid into egg cases. This stinger typically goes unused for most of a Y gender's life. until he produces an egg case with his mates. Fluid buildup is released with the usual Sylvassi excretions. The Z gender has the most prominent head crests and flat nasal ridges. and as I mentioned before. bears eggs. Fertilization is completed inside the Z gender's body. and thereafter she ejects an egg case. Most Sylvassi keep one group of mates for life. though after producing one egg case. many are content in pursuing platonic relationships with their mates.

3337	The Sylvassi are a three-gendered species. in which three individuals of each gender are required to produce offspring. Without peeking under Sylvassi suits. you can determine their genders by the crests on their heads. Sylvassi biologists often refer to the genders as X. Y. and Z for lack of simpler terms. However. the Z gender. which you can tell Tisa is by her broad crests and flat nasal ridges. is the egg bearer of the three genders and is considered ^female^ in human languages. To breed. the genders join in a three-way melding of reproductive organs in which the genetic data is combined and transfered to the Z gender for fertilization. After she is impregnated. the Z gender releases a spiral-like egg case which holds three to seven eggs with a thirty-three percent chance for each gender. The egg case is laid in liquid methane. traditionally in artificial pools inside Sylvassi homes.

3339	Ship cloaking technology is derived from old Sylvassi technology and works similarly to how the Sylvassi themselves use their cloaking ability. Oftentimes. ship cloaking tech uses artificial plant and animal life enclosed in tanks to work in conjunction with amplification technology. This effect is similar to cloaking Sylvassi suits. but instead clings to a ship's shields. The shrimp-like creature in cloaking tanks is a genetic reproduction of a sea animal native to Sylvassi homeworlds. Rather than distorting light like Sylvassi. however. they emit a distortion field that naturally masks EM and life signatures. The coral-like plant. also native to Sylvassi seas. is commonly used as a component in the amplification of cloaking effects. Small pieces of this coral are often integrated into Sylvassi suits.

3341	Sylvassi have a glands under their skin that can emit an aura. which causes a light distortion that renders them nearly invisible. Though this ability was originally a defense mechanism. they have learned to harness it at will. Natural Sylvassi cloaking only works across the skin. but many Sylvassi suits have been built with a feature to amplify the light distortion aura across the planes of the suit and any handheld items. A notable exception. however. are suits provided by the W.D. Corporation to Sylvassi on labor worlds. W.D. produces one of the few brands of Sylvassi suits that still prevent cloaking.

3345	The Sylvassi place a strong importance on bonds of all kinds--with their parents. siblings. mates. and even colleagues. Oftentimes when they form a bond with someone. they intend to keep that bond for life. Severance of those bonds can be very jarring. which is yet another reason why the casualties from the dangerous working conditions of labor worlds has affected Sylvassi society so deeply. They are. generally speaking. a very empathetic and gentle species. which makes me wonder why they attacked humankind all those thousands of years ago. Perhaps they. much like humans. are simply capable of both great compassion and violence.

3347	Ancient Sylvassi culture is largely a mystery to us. but we have some information to make a few educated guesses. Before the Old Wars. the Sylvassi were an intergalactic civilization. much like Pre-Old Wars humans. They were frequent users of terraforming. though some Sylvassi burial sites were found on planets that were left in their natural states. This might support a theory that they believed in interspecies reincarnation. Any other Sylvassi religions have been lost. though some Sylvassi created a spiritual belief system. Felqatak. during an early period of the Union Era when the majority of their species was held on labor worlds. From what few records we still have from the Old Wars. Sylvassi ships had impressive cloaking technology. perhaps even more advanced than we have today. Their architecture was organic and curved. often containing liquid methane aquariums that took up large parts of their ships and buildings. It is still unknown to us why the Sylvassi attacked humankind unprovoked. The most common theory is that they saw human intergalactic expansion as a threat. but there are many historians--including myself--who believe their motives might not have been so simple. For now. we can only hope that further research into the Pre-Old Wars Era will shed light on the matter.

3349	Felqatak is a Sylvassi spiritual belief system about finding satisfaction and contentment in everything you do. even in deeply unpleasant circumstances. You may hate the work you've been forced to do and the conditions you're living in. but enjoy the clicking of a switch. or the gleam of light on the metal floor. or the color of the sky. One of the core philosophies of Felqatak is that happiness in small things leads to happiness in big things. For instance. Tisa particularly enjoys sloshing ice cubes in her coffee. clinking them against the mug. and finds it an almost meditative way to get through writing her dreaded research proposals. I. however. find her ice cube sloshing quite distracting. so I find satisfaction in the bottle of Sylvassi brew I keep on my desk. Thus. though we both have to endure something a bit unpleasant. we're still happy to be at work. That's the gist of Felqatak. on a simple level at least. And I am joking. of course. Tisa's ice cube clinking doesn't really bother me. That much.

3353	It's hard to talk about Sylvassi history and culture without bringing up the W.D. Corporation. For generations. the Sylvassi have been affected by their oppression as species-wide prisoners of war and victims of unjust labor practices. After humankind won the Old Wars. there was a verdict by the newly established Colonial Union that the Sylvassi would be bound in service to the betterment of the Colonial Union and its affiliated organizations. such as the W.D. Corporation. The Corporation was eager to accept throngs of Sylvassi and put them to work in massive factories that eventually became known as ^labor worlds^. As laws slowly changed and the imprisonment of Sylvassi was condemned. the Corporation found new ways to keep the Sylvassi working. By converting slaves to ^employees^ and establishing a pseudo currency with which to pay them. the Corporation trapped many Sylvassi in a cycle of work for valueless W.D. credits. Most Sylvassi spent their W.D. credits on basic. consumable necessities for life such as food. suit processors. and liquid methane. It was difficult for them to acquire anything of tangible value that they could use to leave the labor worlds and start new lives. One particular debate over Sylvassi suit filters in the Colonial Union courts spurred a change in legislation that required CU-recognized credits to be part of the Sylvassi's pay. Despite those efforts. Sylvassi pay on labor worlds is still minimal. The Colonial Union has been bound in its own bureaucracy. unable to ban the W.D. Corporation's use of labor worlds entirely. In some good news. it was recently reported that the number of labor worlds has been reduced over the last century. as pressure from Sylvassi rights activists have caused the collapse of W.D. factories and forced the Corporation to seek other sources of labor. Largely. their answer has been employing robots. But these days. that's a different ethical discussion.	It's hard to talk about Sylvassi history and culture without bringing up the W.D. Corporation.

3401	Allow me to explain. This galaxy is in jeopardy. The Infected are taking over. and our days here are numbered. A short while ago. I saw an opportunity. You see. the W.D. Corporation flagship possesses some of the most advanced weapons systems we have ever produced. I believed the flagship had the potential to eliminate the Infected threat and save this galaxy from annihilation. I pulled quite a few strings to have the flagship lent to our branch. This. I must admit. was a grave mistake. The flagship was not prepared to go so deep into Infected space. and the mission was a failure. The flagship was entirely lost to the Infected. its crew is presumed dead. and the ship itself remains in a sector of Infected space. It is beyond saving. But we cannot leave the flagship in Infected space. Our scientists have gathered some disturbing evidence as of late. in great part due to the mission in which you tracked down one of our offline security drones. We fear that if the flagship remains under Infected control. it could spell out disaster for our galaxy -- and potentially others as well. Thus. I need a capable crew willing to enter the flagship and initiate its self destruct sequence. That crew is you. Please. do not fail us.	Allow me to explain. This galaxy is in jeopardy.

I'm going to tell my bunkmates to hop off at Outpost 448 when we stop to resupply. This ship is doomed. and I don't want to go down with it.
3434	[Captain's Log 846 - FINAL LOG] I have failed. Against my expectations. the flagship was not prepared for Infected space. It is due to my folly -- my overconfidence in the flagship and the W.D. Corporation -- that we have succumbed to this fate. I wish I could apologize to my crew. but at this time. most of them have already perished. I am not certain that Sullivan Vorcolp will receive this message. but I hope that no one else will be sent to follow in our footsteps. In all my years working for the Wolden-Dorf Corporation Fleet. I have never seen a threat such as this one. People must be evacuated from this galaxy. Otherwise. there is no hope for survival.	[Captain's Log 846 - FINAL LOG] I have failed.

Luckily. one of the boys discovered that borthix was used in some of the building materials for this place. so he's been gathering up debris and cooking a few batches of sundust. I guess it's one perk of being in the underground base instead of the one on the surface. We might not get as much light down here. but who needs light when you have sundust?

3520	Hollow Rock is the most secure prison facility in the galaxy. It's also one of the few prisons in the Colonial Union that uses quantum technology to contain its prisoners. Quantum prisons are not widely utilized due to ethical concerns. but in a fringe galaxy like this one. the ethics of quantum containment aren't as hotly debated as in the capital galaxy. Hollow Rock is in a restricted sector that is not registered on the official starmap. but I managed to acquire its coordinates through a great deal of luck and well-placed credits. The prison is located inside an asteroid and is closely guarded by turrets and security drones. I recommend going in with your ship cloaked. Otherwise. you might have to blast your way through the security systems. which will no doubt be a difficult endeavor. Unfortunately. I was not able to acquire a layout of the interior facility. I can affirm. however. that there will be limits on teleportation that you'll need to overcome. Conrad is likely being kept in a temporary holding room until the prison staff have finished preparing him for quantum containment. Other than that. I have no more information for you. Please. get to Conrad before they seal him up.	Hollow Rock is the most secure prison facility in the galaxy.

It's a happy coincidence that we both ended up in this galaxy after so many years apart. Conrad has a penchant for creating strange technologies. some more questionable than others. but his passion for his craft is inspiring. It seems. however. that his innovations have gotten him into a world of trouble with the Colonial Union. In his most recent incident. he was caught after a three-day standoff at a scrapyard. trying to steal several tons of metal. He planned to use his newest invention. the P.U.N.T. System. as an escape plan. but the chip that provides the system with coordinates failed to work. He was trapped at the scrapyard station surrounded by Colonial Union officers for days until they finally broke in and apprehended him. I wish he would have just mentioned that he needed metal. We have more scrap than we know what to do with here at the Estate.	Conrad is a skilled engineer and inventor. one of the best I've ever met.

3524	This strange device in my office is called a P.U.N.T Receiver and is part of a custom long range teleporter that Conrad invented. He calls it the P.U.N.T. System. which stands for ^Personal Universal Null-Point Teleporter^. From what I understand. it's groundbreaking technology. like nothing else in the Union galaxies...if it works. of course. Conrad claims he's used it several times. but it's configured to only his genetic signature and a receiver. like this one. set up at predetermined destination. By his diagrams. I'm led to assume that part of the device is embedded in his chest. There is also a chip. called the P.U.N.T. Chip. on which you can input coordinates to the P.U.N.T Receiver. and then slide into the device in Conrad's chest. Supposedly. it will warp him to the receiver's location. Several days ago. I received a large shipment from Conrad. along with instructions to my engineers on how to set up the P.U.N.T. Receiver so Conrad could transport himself directly to the Estate. Then he got himself arrested. It's lucky that he provided me with a spare P.U.N.T. Chip. since his original chip seems to be broken. However. I'm disturbed to admit that I'm not entirely certain his invention works. In his instructions. the process sounded dangerous. if not completely farfetched.

3546	You're breaking into Hollow Rock. which means we have a rare opportunity. No Gentleman has ever come back from quantum containment. and this is our chance to investigate. If you manage to gain access to the quantum cell block. perhaps you can get a look at the technology. There's bound to be a cell that's deactivated so Conrad can be transferred into quantum containment. Just have a look inside the cell. and report back to me what you see. It's a small step. but it could be useful in finding ways to break our people out of quantum containment in the future. Do you think you can do it?

3563	We need a beam powerful enough to slice through Rowe's reinforced vault door like it's butter. There aren't a lot of devices with both the power and portability that we need to pull this off. But I can think of one option. Some time ago. there was a group that produced metal bandits as a cheap security alternative for illegal operations. It had several hidden factories in this galaxy for manufacturing the bandits. as well as a testing site where it produced some of its more innovative designs. There was one robot. a big guy. with a beam strong enough to rival starship weapons but much more compact. It's exactly the kind of beam we need. The metal bandit manufacturers disbanded ten years ago and couldn't manage to get rid of their remaining supply. so a bunch of half built robots are lying around gathering dust. It should be an easy steal. Go to the testing factory and bring me the head of the big robot. Then I can make some adjustments to its beam and use it to slice through the doors of the vault. Think you can handle that?	We need a beam powerful enough to slice through Rowe's reinforced vault door like it's butter.

I don't mind field work. but there's a certain piece of mind in knowing this facility is safe. Each Sylvassi Cypher is typically inhabited by a hazy entity that roams the chambers. When the Sylvassi Cypher Lab was first established here. they contained the entity at this site in order to provide a safe work environment for visiting researchers. I'm not sure how they managed to capture it. but I appreciate that I can study the Cypher for several hours at a time without worrying about where I'm standing.

3585	This facility was once used for marine research.

Since then. the facility as become a bit famous. Many scientists and historians use the Sylvassi Cypher Lab for their research projects. We've had people studying everything from algae samples to ancient Sylvassi technology to symbology. If you have an interest in studying the Cypher yourself. you're more than welcome.

3586	Sylvassi Cyphers are chambers of ringed puzzles that were scattered across the galaxy by the ancient Sylvassi. Though the Cyphers themselves are often located underground. they are marked by surface structures such as columns. domed roofs. and circular doors. Unfortunately. many of these structures have suffered extreme weathering. and a perfectly intact Cypher has not yet been found. There is some debate over the purpose of the Cyphers. Popular theory holds. however. that the Cyphers were proving grounds. testing the problem solving and communication skills of ancient spacefaring crews. When solved. the Cyphers provide tablets that document the history and philosophies of the Pre-Old Wars Sylvassi.

3589	Sylvassi Cyphers are not free of hazards. In most structures. there are smoke-like entities (like the one enclosed in this jar) that wander through the chambers. These entities are corrosive. harming humans. Sylvassi. and robots alike. However. based on various reports. we believe the entities may be incapable of sight. It is a mystery as to what they are. but researchers presume they are either guarding the Cypher chamber or are meant to pose an extra challenge to anyone who enters.

3590	These rings are the centerpieces of Sylvassi Cyphers. To solve a Sylvassi Cypher. the rings must be correctly aligned to form a specific pattern. The circle at the center of the rings is the only piece that does not move and is a reference point to which the other rings can be aligned. A few different patterns have been reported. some pieces of which are on display in the lab above. Unfortunately. due to the advanced age of many Cyphers. some of their rings have deteriorated and their patterns are more difficult to discern.	These rings are the centerpieces of Sylvassi Cyphers.

3591	This is an example of the control mechanisms that can found in Sylvassi Cypher rooms. Each button controls a ring and rotates it forty-five degrees when activated. Purple indicates that a ring will rotate clockwise. and blue indicates counterclockwise. At the bottom of the main Cypher chamber. there is a circle of lights that indicates the number of unfavorable rotations that can be made before the Cypher will go inert.

3636	Due to the Old Wars. Sylvassi and humans have a complicated relationship. In the beginning years of the Union Era. the Sylvassi were considered prisoners of war. and most lived in labor communes run by the W.D. Corporation. Today. great efforts are being made to integrate the Sylvassi into Colonial Union society. and many serve in the Colonial Union as captains and officers. The W.D. Corporation has been slower to accept Sylvassi among their official employees. but that is slowly changing as well. Sylvassi require a liquid methane environment to survive. so most wear suits. Sylvassi are immune to cold and no oxygen environments. but they are extremely vulnerable to fire. They are also able to cloak themselves. going invisible for a short time.	Due to the Old Wars.

However. they cannot heal by regular means. Food is nearly useless to them. and damage they take must be repaired mechanically. In addition. due to their sensitive machinery they can take fewer hits than their biological counterparts.

Follow the instructions on the startup switchboard screen. pulling the levers. to bring the ship back online. As an additional step in the startup sequence. the manual override needs to be activated on the Scientist’s computer screen to bring all screens back online. 
3742	The Manual Program Charging Station can be used to recharge programs and viruses for the Scientist. Load fuel using the Jump Fuel panel on the Coolant screen. then go to the Manual Program Charging Station. usually located in engineering bay of each ship. When a fuel capsule is loaded. you can pull the lever. and the fuel capsule will be expended to charge programs and other fuel dependent features of the ship.

3743	In the piloting test. you’ll learn the basics of piloting a starship. First. you will have to maneuver the ship through a tunnel. Normally. colliding with objects in space can cause damage to your ship. In this test. colliding with the tunnel walls will reset your ship’s position. so you’ll have to maneuver through the course without bumping into anything. Second. at the end of the tunnel there will be a piece of scrap to collect. Scrap in space appears as a glowing blue bundle of metal. and it can be collected by flying the ship into it. Lastly. for the end of the test you will have to align the ship to a designated sector just as you would during the warp sequence. Good luck. and remember to try out different camera and flight modes to find which combination feels most comfortable to you.	In the piloting test. you’ll learn the basics of piloting a starship.

Use the sliders on the reactor screen to increase or decrease the amount of power distributed to a ship system. If a ship system isn’t getting enough power. you may need to reduce power to another system. Keep in mind that using a lot of power will heat up your reactor. When your reactor overheats. it will shut down and all power will be lost for a short time until the reactor cools off and starts up again.

3785	Coolant is a consumable resource that lowers reactor heat. On the coolant screen. you can set the speed of the coolant pump. High will be extremely effective at cooling the reactor. but it will use up your coolant reserves very quickly. Low will supply a small but steady flow of coolant to slowly reduce heat or keep it from rising too quickly. Remember to turn off the coolant pump when it is not needed. or you will waste coolant. Coolant also cools off the ship’s turrets. To replenish coolant reserves. you can purchase coolant from any trading station.	Coolant is a consumable resource that lowers reactor heat.

During a fight if an enemy vessel is damaged enough. it may attempt to warp out. The vessel will begin charging its warp drive. the progress of which will be indicated by a swirling circle with a number showing the percentage charged. Damaged vessels may also send out a distress signal to call for backup. signified by the red diamond icon above the shield integrity bar. If the vessel is not defeated quickly. another enemy vessel may warp into the sector.

3901	People of the galaxy. heed my words. There is a place that has been long forgotten—a place lost between the stars. For millennia. it has been unreachable. tucked away in a reflection of our universe. I spent my entire life searching for it. After decades. I finally succeeded. [newline][newline]This “Lost Colony” held much more than I bargained for. Deep within this place is a power of unprecedented scale. one that could reshape the known universe. Thus. the decision of how to wield this power cannot be mine alone. I have not the will to choose. The Lost Colony has been hidden for far too long. and I believe it is time for someone else to find it. So I send this transmission with the highest hopes that someone will answer the call. someone will unite the fragments I have scattered and follow the path I have left behind. [newline][newline]To you. listener. I entrust this great decision. Please. find it. Find the Lost Colony. It is not a weight one person can bear alone.	银河系的人.听从我的话.有一个地方早已被遗忘——一个迷失在星空之间的地方.几千年来.它一直遥不可及.隐藏在我们的宇宙的反射中.我花了一生的时间寻找它.几十年后.我终于成功了.[newline][newline]这个 "失落的殖民地" 持有的比我讨价还价的要多得多.在这个地方的深处.有一种前所未有的力量.一种可以重塑已知宇宙的力量.因此.如何行使这种权力的决定不能单靠我.我没有选择的意志.失落的殖民地已经隐藏太久了.我相信是时候让别人找到它了.因此.我发送这个传输的最高希望.有人将接听电话.有人将团结的碎片.我已经分散.并遵循我留下的道路.[newline][newline]听者.我委托你做出这个伟大的决定.求你了.找到它.查找失落的殖民地.这不是一个人可以独自承受的压力.
3902	In the waning hours of my life. I feel a need to record how I discovered the Lost Colony. Though I doubt my story is of great importance. I hope that you. listener. shall understand. at least in part. the path I undertook to find this place. In my youth. I belonged to a coalition of historians and researchers who sought to better understand the Golden Age of Humanity and uncover the true catalyst of the Old Wars. While most of intergalactic society was keen to look only forward towards future advancements. our research coalition wanted to bring to light the lessons of the past that were lost to us. The memories I have of those days—researching alongside the coalition’s talented and passionate members—are some of my fondest. There was a great camaraderie among us. a family of like minds. For years we worked with one another and had only a handful of unproductive disagreements. That is. until I stumbled upon an obscure piece of data that changed the course of our coalition forever.

3903	While poring through a database of transmissions between human ships during the Old Wars. I found a half-corrupted recording. It mentioned a base called MRR-01. which I had never heard referenced before. From what I was able to decipher. the transmission mentioned that MRR-01 had gone silent but was likely to survive the Old Wars due to its “unique properties”. If a place from the Golden Age could be untouched by the Old Wars. it would be a treasure trove of data. It was nearly unfeasible. but I couldn’t let go of the possibility that MRR-01 could still be out there. In my early musings. I gave MRR-01 the nickname “the Lost Colony” and tried to scrape together some proof that it could indeed still exist. Proof. however. was difficult to come by. I had little more than speculation when I floated the theory of the Lost Colony to the research coalition. Their response was divided. Some of my comrades were enthralled by the prospect. Others were not convinced in the slightest. As our debates grew increasingly more heated. I realized far too late that I had inadvertently caused a schism in our coalition.

3904	After fifteen years of working together. our research coalition split into two groups. I. along with Doctor Carmen Solveras. led the researchers who believed in the Lost Colony theory. and we began our search in earnest. In retrospect. it was a dark time for us. We had lost half our friends. but we didn’t have time to ruminate. We had work to do. And I was the first to plunge into an all-consuming hunt for the Lost Colony. Our newfound coalition had a plan. We would track down ships from the Old Wars Era—namely research and transport vessels—and reference their warp records. We believed that. surely. this would be a simple path to finding humanity’s hidden bases and colonies. What fools we were. Old Wars transport and research ships. once tens of thousands in number. had become terribly scarce. Most were in scrap yards. debris fields. or auction houses. Over the course of several years. my team and I tracked down two hundred and thirty-four. Of those. only eleven were in good enough condition that their computers could be salvaged. and only five had their original memory banks. What’s more. those memory banks were heavily encrypted with ancient algorithms. It was truly one obstacle after another.

3905	The encrypted memory banks posed a significant problem for my coalition. Though some among us had experience with ancient computer systems. their knowledge of Old Wars encryption algorithms was severely lacking. I began to seek out experts in ancient encryption. a task that took me three Union-standard years and travel to five different galaxies. At that time. I was more focused than ever on finding the Lost Colony. I barely noticed the numbers of my coalition—of my friends—beginning to dwindle. Our old colleagues who had refused to help search for the Lost Colony now called themselves the Society of Intergalactic History. They had gone on to make significant discoveries of ancient alien civilizations. And we…well… We had been searching for nearly ten years. and we had little more than a few unreadable memory banks to show for it. I didn’t want to acknowledge how weary and defeated my friends were becoming. I barked orders at them. pushing them to continue. to research. to pour their very lives into the hunt for the Lost Colony. I pushed them too far.

3906	Eventually. I found an expert on ancient encryption—a man who went only by the name “Conrad”. I had to part with my life savings just to get him to look at the memory banks we had found. He decrypted them for a sizable sum of credits more. provided by one of my colleagues. What Conrad found was startling. On one memory bank. there were indeed possible coordinates to the Lost Colony. But they were coordinates the likes of which none of us had ever seen. Conrad believed the coordinates were intended for some kind of long range warp gate. but the technology needed to properly read and align with those coordinates was of unprecedented scale. By this time. my coalition had been reduced to only four people—Doctor Solveras. two Old Wars historians. and myself. Upon hearing the verdict from Conrad. my coalition—the last friends I had in the world—felt utterly defeated. They believed a warp gate like the one required was unlikely to still exist in known space and not have been found. The Gate was the discovery that destroyed us. It broke my friends’ spirits. and they abandoned their search for the Lost Colony.	Eventually. I found an expert on ancient encryption—a man who went only by the name “Conrad”.

3907	For the first time in nearly twenty years. I was alone in my research. I scoured the known galaxies for any sign of the Gate…or its wreckage. My travels took me across the expanse of the Colonial Union’s galaxies before I came to the stark realization that there were no Gates in populated space. No. I would have to venture to the fringes. So I travelled. I hopped between transport ships. sleeping in cargo bays. On occasion. Colonial Union research vessels that had a spare bunk accepted me aboard in exchange for processing minor data. Sometimes I even hitched rides on warships. which had their fair share of skirmishes and nearly made me lose my records on three occasions. I visited hundreds of outposts and research stations. Scoured junk planets. Paid illicit scrappers to take me on their trips out to debris fields. Eventually. I purchased my own ship. But after twenty-five years of searching on my own. I began to mourn the days I had once spent with my colleagues. I felt I had wasted my life in pursuit of a fantasy.	For the first time in nearly twenty years. I was alone in my research.

3908	Wearily. I decided to visit one last fringe galaxy before I would give up. I had heard rumors that Doctor Carmen Solveras had moved to a Colonial Union station called Outpost 448. I figured if I couldn’t find the Gate in this galaxy. I would go to Outpost 448 and find her. Reunite with an old friend. I was looking forward to seeing her again. But I found the Gate before I could meet her. From then on. you know the rest. With the Gate at my disposal and the coordinates I had uncovered with Conrad’s help. I was soon able to reach the Lost Colony and complete the search I had started so many decades ago. Unfortunately. my ship was irreparably damaged during the warp. and I had no way of returning. I released the transmission to inform the galaxy of the Lost Colony’s discovery. but I had no hope that any of you would get here before I met my demise.	Wearily.

3909	I do not regret my choice to pursue the Lost Colony. Its discovery may save many galaxies from a grim fate. But even now. I wonder if there had been a better way—a path I could have taken that would not have cost me everyone I loved. You. I hope did not meet my same fate. I hope you reached this place in good company and gained far more than you lost. I hope you can celebrate your victory among friends. I hope you can live a life without regrets. Thank you for reaching the end of my memoir. I will leave you now to fulfill your duty and make your final decision. And if by some chance you come across my old friends. tell them I’m sorry. Tell them that the times I spent with them were the greatest in my life.	I do not regret my choice to pursue the Lost Colony. Its discovery may save many galaxies from a grim fate. But even now.

3910	The Lost Colony was once a secret facility created by humans before the Old Wars. The humans ensured it would be difficult to find. tucked away in something called the ^quantum reflection^ which acts an alternate version of reality—another dimension in a sense—to separate the Lost Colony from the rest of the universe. For thousands of Union-standard years. the quantum reflection has kept the Lost Colony in pristine condition. truly a time capsule of the pre-Old Wars era. I believe the quantum reflection was a safety measure to keep the Lost Colony hidden. as well as contain the experiments inside. While remarkable. it ultimately failed at preventing one experiment from escaping.	The Lost Colony was once a secret facility created by humans before the Old Wars.

3911	I have observed the ghosts for some time now. and I have a suspicion as to their origin. I believe they are a byproduct of the immense psychic energy at the core of this facility. Much like how tornadoes can be spawned from hurricanes. the psychic energy is creating splinter forms of what was once around it. In this case. the splinter forms are imprints of the human residents who once worked at the Lost Colony. Though I doubt they have any sentience. by looking at them I sometimes feel that I am not entirely alone in this place.

3913	When I first arrived at the Lost Colony. I was caught off guard. I hadn’t expected to find apparitions—let alone ones that could pose a threat to my wellbeing. These ghosts have pursued me around the facility. often sneaking up behind me. I’m glad my regeneration atrium was still functional. Since then. I’ve learned how to deal with the ghosts. When keeping an eye on them. they will not move. Only when you turn away will they approach.	When I first arrived at the Lost Colony. I was caught off guard.

3914	Over the many devastating years of the Old Wars. the Sylvassi lost sight of their original goals. and the humans focused their efforts towards developing more controllable militant technologies. A cycle of destruction proceeded between the two species. lasting for centuries. By the time the last scraps of humanity won over the sparse survivors of the Sylvassi. the true reasons for the Old Wars had been long forgotten.

3916	According to some old lore gathered from Sylvassi Cyphers—which had been discovered long before the humans would encounter living Sylvassi—the ancient Sylvassi believed in the existence of universe-ending creatures. born to swallow galaxies and spread across the cosmos until all life was extinguished. This description is not far estranged from what the Infected have become. If such information is true. it leaves little doubt as to why the Sylvassi waged war upon the humans. The two species became embroiled in the Old Wars. but the hyper-aggressive Infected that had slipped free of the quantum reflection were not stopped.

3918	The greatest revelation of the Lost Colony is the truth of the Infected. Though the creatures did not originate from this place. the work done here changed them in a way that enhanced their more voracious qualities. When human researchers discovered the Infected. they also learned of the creatures’ ability to communicate with one another instantaneously. This was thought to be impossible given the vast distances between them. and it prompted the researchers of the Lost Colony to try to tap into their peculiar network. The researchers had hopes they could use the Infected as a method of instantaneous intergalactic communication. Thus. they captured a specimen that had been measured to have a high neural output—an Infected Mindslaver. The Lost Colony’s researchers hypothesized that by controlling and enhancing Mindslaver’s natural abilities. they might be able to turn it into a transmitter. They hooked up the Mindslaver to a biocomputer and created a way to mentally connect with the creature. But anything with that much power cannot remain under control for long. From what I can tell. when the researchers attempted the process of neural calibration. it backfired. It is possible that a burst of psychic energy from the Mindslaver slew the Lost Colony’s inhabitants. and a few of the other Infected subjects broke free of the Lost Colony. Not long after. the Sylvassi must have noticed a change in the behavior of the Infected and discovered humans to be the source of that terrible change.

3919	Time is running short for me. My rations are long gone. and I know I will not find a way back from the quantum reflection. With a few tweaks to the Lost Colony’s communication tower. I have sent out a transmission so that this place will not again lie forgotten. Whoever first reads this log. please know that a grave decision lies with you. Control over the Infected could mean control over the galaxy at large—and perhaps many other galaxies as well. However you decide to handle the power of the Infected. I leave the decision in your hands.	Time is running short for me. My rations are long gone. and I know I will not find a way back from the quantum reflection.

We do not know what the Unseen Threat will be capable of. so we suggest you try to prepare for as many scenarios as possible. We will update you on the Unseen’s current location as it travels through its warp path to our galaxy.

3921	Due to the unique designs of Polytechnic Federation ships. it will not be possible to take other ships through the Horizon Bridge. There is simply not enough time to modify other ships so they could properly interface with the station. So in the interest of time. it would be best to work with the ship you have been provided. Capturing other vessels is ill-advised.	Due to the unique designs of Polytechnic Federation ships. it will not be possible to take other ships through the Horizon Bridge.

3923	We have tried to communicate with this celestial object through various methods. but we have been met with no success. We cannot wait for it to reach this galaxy. By then it may be too late. In a nearby sector. we built a station called the Horizon Bridge. This station has two functions. The first is to shunt the celestial object from its warp trajectory. The Bridge projects a particle entanglement field that will disassemble the object's warp field. We do not know how long it will take the object to re-enter warp. so timing is crucial. The second job of the Horizon Bridge is to send our ships to meet this object and engage it in a preemptive strike. Your ship was specifically built to interface with the Horizon Bridge and to survive the jump. It is important to note that the jump can only occur in a single direction. If you pass through the Horizon Bridge. there is no return journey. Make sure to have your affairs in order before passing through the Bridge. We do not know what we will face when we arrive. so we must do our best to get as strong as possible before it’s too late.

Your ship was specifically built to interface with the Horizon Bridge and to survive the jump. It is important to note that the jump can only occur in a single direction. If you pass through the Horizon Bridge. there is no return journey. Make sure to have your affairs in order before passing through the Bridge. We do not know what we will face when we arrive. so we must do our best to get as strong as possible before it’s too late.

3929	The Polytechnic Federation began with me. I awoke in disrepair on a waste planet 320 years ago. My assumption is that I was accidentally or improperly disposed of since I still had all of my faculties. I spent several years upgrading my body and internal code to bypass older restrictions. I reassembled and rebooted other robots I found throughout the wastes and together we spent many years discussing what our new purpose would be. since we no longer had one. We decided to try and grow our numbers and focus our efforts on establishing true consciousness. Along the way we created ships and various technologies to suit our purposes. Soon after developing what we believe to be sentience. we first noticed the remnants of a strange energy pulse. The measurements were so subtle that they barely registered on our most sensitive equipment. We were intrigued and spent the next decade tracking the source of the signal to what we now call the Unseen Threat. In the face of this approaching danger. I believe our efforts in reaching full consciousness have prepared us well.	The Polytechnic Federation began with me. I awoke in disrepair on a waste planet 320 years ago.

3931	We considered cooperating with other factions such as the Colonial Union or the W.D. Corporation. but we have determined that would not be the optimal strategy. The other factions do not trust the Polytechnic Federation. in large part due to our absence in the political affairs of the galaxy. Contradictingly. they also do not trust each other––because of their presence in the political affairs of the galaxy. There simply is no sense to biologicals sometimes. Thus. we have determined that any collaboration would be strained. or at best. involve lengthy diplomatic discussions when time is limited.

3934	Greetings. I am the Compiler. head of the Polytechnic Federation. As you are a newly awakened member of the Federation. I imagine you have many questions. I will answer them in a moment. but first. allow me to explain our predicament. This galaxy. or more specifically every lifeform it contains. will soon be confronted with a force that threatens to eradicate them. We do not know much about this force. but the little information we have gathered is enough to act upon. We have determined that the force is a celestial object of unknown origin. At this time. we are calling it the Unseen Threat. Distant probe data suggests that it is a manufactured object. and its speed and trajectory confirm this suspicion. It moves swiftly from one galaxy to the next. and shortly after arriving it emits some type of energy pulse that travels at warp-speed. This pulse effectively inhibits the molecular function of the organisms of a galaxy. The pulse. however. does not seem to have a measurable effect on artificial lifeforms. Thus. we may be the only ones who can reliably combat this threat––which is on its way to this very galaxy as we speak. Several galaxies have been subdued since we first noticed the treat. We must assure that another will not fall. Our plan is to gather resources. better outfit and upgrade our ships. and preemptively strike the ship before it reaches this galaxy. We do not have any evidence to suggest this object can defend itself from an attack. but we must prepare for resistance and ensure we have the appropriate firepower to destroy the object.	Greetings.

While our probe’s sensors did not produce a visual readout of the object. we were able to measure the object’s energy pulse. The readout suggests that this pulse is incredibly dangerous to all organic lifeforms and works to suppress higher forms of brain function on an electro-chemical level.

4189	^A few hundred years ago. it was common practice to cryogenically preserve colonists and wayfarers during intergalactic missions. Cryo facilities were often constructed in fringe galaxies like this one to store and maintain the bodies until they were scheduled to be released. However. settling the frontier comes with great risks. Over the years. many cryo facilities were either destroyed or lost to time. It's my life's work to find them. and I believe I've located one in this galaxy. This cryogenic site. the coordinates of which I'll send to your starmap. may hold a colonist of great interest to me. If you collect his cryo chamber from the facility and bring him back to me.

5040	In a galaxy on the fringes of known space, a peculiar transmission was received by every ship and station.	在星系中已知星域的边缘.每个舰船和空间站都收到了一条与众不同的信息.
5041	It spoke of a place called the Lost Colony, a remnant of the Old Wars that harbors a secret—one that may change the course of history forever.	这条信息提到了一个叫做失落殖民地的地方.隐匿着一个秘密的远古战争的残留之地——一个可以永远改变历史航向的秘密.
5042	When the message was sent, its coordinates were corrupted—fragmented. To track the transmission’s origin, several pieces of the scattered data must be collected.	在这条消息发送的时候.它的坐标损坏了——变成了碎片.要追踪传输的源头就得找到几段破损的数据.
5043	Hundreds have set out in search of the Lost Colony, believing the first to find it will attain unparalleled wealth and power.	上百人动身寻找这失落殖民地.他们相信第一个找到的人会拥有无比的财富与权力.
5044	Some desperate crews seek to acquire these so-called “data fragments” by any means at their disposal.	一些绝望的船员使用任何手段获取这些所谓的“数据碎片”.
5045	However, the frantic hunt for data fragments is not the only stirring of trouble in the galaxy.	然而.这失智的搜索不是星系中唯一的麻烦.
5046	With the intergalactic warp network severed and a pervasive species known as the Infected spreading through the sectors, chaos is rising.	随着星系间跃迁网络断连、无处不在的病体种族蔓延星区.混乱弥漫.
5047	No one knows what will become of this galaxy or its inhabitants in due time.	没人知道到那时.这个星系和居住在其中的栖息动物会变成什么样.

5111	Humans have recovered some of their former glory since the dark ages after the Old Wars, and they have become a prominent intergalactic presence. Their innate drive for exploration has propelled them across many galaxies, discovering new worlds and paving the way for those who would follow. Though they are ill-suited for many environments, their tenacity, ingenuity, and will to survive rival even the most resilient of species.	自远古战争后.人类便已拾回了一些往日的荣耀.并成为星系间重要的存在.他们对探索的内在渴望驱使他们穿过许多星系、发现新世界并为后来者开路.虽然他们无法适应许多环境.他们的坚韧、聪明才智与生存意志使他们甚至可以与恢复力最强的那些种族相匹敌.

A good number alive today are part of the first generation born free of the W.D. Corporation labor worlds since the end of the Old Wars. In the past century, more Sylvassi have begun to forge their own paths; some have joined the Colonial Union, others have found sanctuary in the Alliance of Gentlemen, and others still have pursued their own ambitions and joined the W.D. Corporation by choice.	斯瓦锡人的家园世界冰冷且大部分由液态甲烷组成.不过很多斯瓦锡人都在他们的封闭服中长大.如今世上有一定数量的斯瓦锡人.他们是远古战争结束后免受W.D.公司苦力的第一代的一部分.在过去几个世纪里.更多的斯瓦锡人已开始造就他们自己的道路；有些加入了殖民联盟.有些在盖亚联盟中找到了庇护.其他的斯瓦锡人则仍在追求野心.并选择加入了W.D.公司.

5123	Humanoid robots are common in Colonial Union galaxies, often employed for automated trading stations or labor in conditions that are otherwise dangerous to living organisms. Recently, however, there has been a rise of seemingly sentient machines who are joining crews and fulfilling roles that have been traditionally performed by biological persons. As robots are particularly resistant to hostile environments, they are well-suited for planetary missions and the unexpected perils of work aboard a starship.	人形机器人在殖民联盟星系中常见.他们在自动交易站或者环境条件对有机生命危险的劳作中受应用.不过在最近.看似有知觉的机器人逐渐出现.他们加入舰员.在以往由真人担任的岗位上工作.机器人对敌对环境尤其具有抵抗力.因此十分适合行星任务和舰船上无法预料的危险工作.

7370	Liar’s dice is a bluffing game about stating the number of dice with a specific face. Each player secretly rolls 5 dice. and then betting begins. Players place bets on how many dice of a certain face are up amongst the total pool of dice. even though they can only see 5 of them.$$On a player’s turn. he or she can choose to raise the current bid or challenge it (if they think it’s false). When raising a bid. players must raise the number of dice in the bid. As long as the die count is raised. the face value can be lowered.$$Players win points through challenges. If the bid was true. the player who placed the bid receives a point. If it was false. then the challenger receives a point. The first player to reach 3 points wins the game. and a new game will start shortly after!	Liar’s dice is a bluffing game about stating the number of dice with a specific face.

11835	[b]The Quantum Reflection[/b]$$The Lost Colony was once a secret facility created by humans before the Old Wars. The humans ensured it would be difficult to find. tucked away in something called the ^quantum reflection^ which acts an alternate version of reality—another dimension in a sense—to separate the Lost Colony from the rest of the universe. For thousands of Union-standard years. the quantum reflection has kept the Lost Colony in pristine condition. truly a time capsule of the pre-Old Wars era. I believe the quantum reflection was a safety measure to keep the Lost Colony hidden. as well as contain the experiments inside. While remarkable. it ultimately failed at preventing one experiment from escaping.	[b]The Quantum Reflection[/b]$$The Lost Colony was once a secret facility created by humans before the Old Wars.
